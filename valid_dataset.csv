' lord patten then issued a barbed comment , saying : ` it may be thought -- however admirable she was -- slightly pushing it to persuade jesus to change its name . ' campaigners have been demanding recognition for lady thatcher since her death in april . they also want her bestowed with a posthumous honorary degree after she was snubbed in 1985 by embittered academics protesting against cuts in university funding . it means lady thatcher is the only oxford-educated prime minister not to have been given an honorary degree , a move that entrenched divisions between the thatcher government and the left-wing educational establishment . when she retired , lady thatcher handed her official papers to the archives centre at churchill college , cambridge , where sir winston churchill 's papers are also kept . in another snide boast , lord patten said oxford 's bodleian library had secured the official papers of lord howe , the former deputy prime minister whose resignation from the thatcher cabinet in 1990 precipitated her downfall . lord patten dismissed demands for the university to make good its snub to lady thatcher three decades after it refused her an honorary degree . they are pictured in 1997 when he was governor of hong kong . boris johnson suggested the idea of a thatcher college to make amends for oxford not awarding her an honorary doctorate . ` it 's absolutely true that margaret thatcher has left her papers to churchill college . ` it 's also true that geoffrey howe has left his papers to the bodleian . ` the conservative party archive is also held in oxford . ` at present the most important issue in oxford about margaret thatcher 's legacy is a campaign starting at her old college somerville to start thatcher scholarships . ` i hope that will be a lasting memorial to an extraordinary woman who changed the way this country is governed . ' asked if lady margaret hall -- an oxford college set up in honour of lady margaret beaufort , founder of the tudor dynasty -- might also honour lady thatcher , he said : ` that lady margaret was the mother of kings and i 'm not sure that 's yet on the -lsb- cards -rsb- . ' lord patten seemed unaware that christ church has already changed its name once . originally called cardinal college after henry viii 's chief minister cardinal wolsey , it was renamed when he fell from grace . mr johnson said last month : ` i 'm still waiting for the oxford dons to accept the gravity of their error , and in the spirit of magnanimity to award baroness thatcher not only a posthumous doctorate , but why not endow a college ? '	 boris johnson said a thatcher college would make amends for not giving ex-pm an honorary doctorate .   but lord patten , chancellor of oxford , said the idea was ` pushing it '   instead lady thatcher 's former college is to offer scholarships . 	670
8246	how per mertesacker must long for the days when he danced onto stage with the world cup in front of an adoring crowd of half a million in berlin . that was in july , a few weeks before his return to arsenal and the promise of a season in which he would silence the doubters and prove his worth as a world champion . there was , to begin with , a world cup hangover . but six months on and his sobering performance has left arsenal fans and arsene wenger nursing a banging headache . per mertesacker looks dejected after arsenal were beaten 3-1 at home to monaco on wednesday night . the defender admits that arsenal will need a ` wonderful night ' in monaco to qualify for the quarter-final . during wednesday 's disastrous 3-1 defeat at home to monaco , mertesacker was at his indecisive and lumbering worst . and this , do n't forget , was arsenal 's captain . for geoffrey kondogbia 's opener -- deflected in via the german -- he was lethargic in his closing of the france midfielder and his limp body was an all-too-easy detour on its path to goal . a john terry , for example , would surely have closed with more aggression and purpose . mertesacker continued to dither and unnerve until his fatal involvement in monaco 's tie-changing second . for reasons only known to the 30-year-old , he chose to chase possession inside the opposition half , a pursuit which was always destined to fail . and so it did . monaco broke , mertesacker was a spectator and dimitar berbatov -- the former fulham reserve -- climaxed their attack with a cool finish . geoffrey kondogbia lets fly and his shot takes a wicked deflection off mertesacker 's chest for the opener . dimitar berbatov enjoyed his second half strike which put the game beyond arsenal . alex oxlade-chamberlain struck a sublime effort deep in injury time which appeared to give the gunners hope . but that was extinguished after yannick ferreira-carrasco punished more defensive laxity to make it 3-1 . in the aftermath of the concession the cameras cut to the forlorn centre-back -- for it took a few seconds to locate him on halfway . but his face was pained , remorseful for his part in the goal . even for the tie-clinching third he was slow to close the scorer , although he had been left brutally exposed by the shortcomings of his team-mates . ironically , mertesacker 's best performance was saved for the post-match rallying cry he issued ahead of the second leg in monaco . ` let 's try to raise everyone 's level at monaco . let 's try to get in our rhythm there . we could have scored more than three goals last night and we can hurt them , ' he said . ` we have to focus on that . we ca n't look back and think too much about this game . we will analyse what went wrong , but when we travel to monaco we have to be on the front foot , be brave and get the best out of ourselves . ' mertesacker celebrates with the world cup trophy in the german dressing room after their victory . mertesacker leads the celebrations in front of the german fans after their world cup triumph in july . -lrb- left to right -rrb- ron-robert zieler , boateng , sami khedira and mertesacker celebrate in berlin after their win . mertesacker can only hope they do not spend too long poring over the ills of the first leg , for he would take star billing in any dvd nasty . leadership -- and , for a second time , let us remind ourselves he is the captain -- comes from the heart of a defence . but mertesacker has cut a subdued and sulky figure all season . sportsmail 's jamie carragher tore into him following his abdication of responsibility during the 3-2 defeat at stoke . it did n't take forensic inspection to determine just how bad he was that afternoon . nor does it take analysis from the game 's sharpest minds to pinpoint the weakness in arsenal 's side right now . indeed , from stumbling giraffes to turning cargo ships , mertesacker was the subject of social-media ridicule in the hours after the loss to monaco . how he must long for the days of summer .	 per mertesacker had nightmare as arsenal lost to monaco on wednesday .   gunners were beaten 3-1 at home in champions league last-16 first leg .   the german was lifting the world cup with his country last july .   read : mertesacker admits arsenal need a ` wonderful night ' in monaco .   read : arsenal reaction - is mertesacker good enough ?   click here for all the latest arsenal news . 	760

' seeking damages : four mau mau survivors who are suing the british government over allegations they were tortured during uprisings in kenya in the 1950s and 1960s . turning to paulo nzili , 85 , who was castrated with a pair of pliers , he said : ` i do not dispute with mr nzili that terrible things happened to him . ' last night martyn day , senior partner at leigh day & co , said : ` our clients are very pleased that the government has accepted that they were tortured . ' the mau mau uprising began in 1952 to end british colonial rule . britain initially dismissed reports of unrest , but later declared a state of emergency -- introducing the death penalty for mau mau members . the violence ended in 1956 , but the state of emergency was only revoked in 1960 . the then colonial secretary , alan lennox-boyd , offered to resign over british troops ' actions during the rebellion . he was persuaded to stay in office by harold macmillan . atrocities : a british guard in a mau mau camp in 1953 . one survivor has told how he was brutally castrated in a detention camp during the rebellion . in july 1959 , enoch powell attacked government policy over the mau mau . speaking about the hola camp , where 11 mau mau were killed after refusing to work , mr powell noted that some mps had described the 11 as ` sub-human ' . he told mps : ` i would say that it is a fearful doctrine , to stand in judgment on a fellow human being and to say , `` because he was such-and-such , therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow '' . ' a year ago , the three kenyans were told by mr justice mccombe that they had ` arguable cases in law ' . he will now decide if a fair trial is possible . the government says it is not . mr mansfield said the foreign office faced ` irredeemable difficulties ' defending itself because key witnesses had died . in a written submission , the fo declared : ` after so long , it is simply impossible . ' last night a fo spokesman said : ` we understand the pain and grievance felt by those on all sides in the bloody events of the kenya emergency period in kenya . '	 thought to be first public declaration by government that brutality occurred .   admission comes as three elderly kenyans seeks damages in the high court .   could open floodgates for thousands of survivors to sue britain for millions . 	703

' but . mcbride 's family says that can not be true , that mcbride would never . hurt anyone and simply needed help in a neighborhood that was strange to . her . and that does n't explain why she was shot in the back of the head . suffering : renisha 's family , including her aunt bernita spinks , say she would never hurt anyone and was shot out of racism , though police reportedly told someone at the scene it was a self-defense case . angry : ` you wanted her dead , ' said dmetria burnett of her cousin renisha 's killer . ` for somebody to shoot her in the head and not think twice about it ? he should n't be free at all ' ` he . did not have to pull that gun out and he did not have to kill my . niece , ' said mcbride 's aunt bernita spinks . ` especially if she was . leaving off the porch .

' spinks said the man should have called 911 instead of just pulling out a firearm . ` the police would have been pulling up in 2 or 3 minutes in dearborn heights , ' she said . spinks believes her niece died because of racism and wonders what would have happened had she been the one who shot a stranger : ` would i be standing here ? no . i 'd be in jail without a bond . ' scene : police have n't named the shooter , but local reports put the scene of the incident -- and of renisha 's final breaths -- on this dearborn heights , michigan suburban front porch . police have thus far released very little information on the case , which tragically parallels a case from just a few weeks back . that 's when 24-year-old jonathan ferrell crashed his car in north carolina on september 14 . as he searched for help in a suburban neighborhood , he knocked on a door . the homeowner called 911 thinking that ferrell , who was black , was trying to break into her home . when police arrived and ferrell approached them , he was tasered . when he continued to approach them , charlotte police officer randall kerrick opened fire and shot him 10 times .	 renisha mcbride was in a middle class white neighborhood outside detroit when she was shot in the back of the head on a area man 's porch around 2:30 am saturday .   police say the homeowner believed he was shooting in self defense , according to a neighbor .   her outraged family says mcbride would n't hurt a soul and her death was a cowardly act of racism . 	727

3680	a man who was sentenced to die yesterday , is now under investigation for five more capital crimes in a different state . a pennsylvania jury deliberated for seven hours on tuesday , before coming to the decision to send 40-year-old charles ray hicks to death row for the january 2008 murder of scranton woman deanna null , 36 . prosecutors said hicks beheaded null alive , before chopping up the rest of her body and dumping the remains in black bags scattered along interstate roads . the remains were recovered by investigators , who also found null 's severed hands hidden in the walls of hicks ' tobyhanna home . on monday , the day before he was sentenced , hicks allegedly confessed to murdering five more women in texas before he moved to pennsylvania , prosecutor michael mancuso said . hicks is originally from fort worth . scroll down for video . going to death row : charles hicks , 40 , is seen leaving court on tuesday after receiving the death penalty for the january 2008 murder of 36-year-old deanna null . ` as i understand it , yesterday he made certain admissions that he killed some women down there , ' mancuso said . ` and that 's going to also be investigated and may result in charges . ' both pennsylvania and texas have the death penalty , but texas follows through on executing their death row inmate at a higher rate than any other state . this year alone , 10 people have been executed by lethal injection in texas compared to just three people in the past two decades in pennsylvania , despite the state having one of the largest death row populations . more victims : before he was sentenced on tuesday , hicks -lrb- right , in 2008 -rrb- allegedly admitted to murdering five other women in texas . pennsylvania victim deanna null -lrb- left -rrb- who was 36 at the time of her death in 2008 . it 's still unclear how these new admissions will impact hicks ' death sentence in pennsylvania , or which state would handle the execution if hicks is convicted of capital crimes in texas . mailonline 's calls to mancuso were not immediately returned wednesday morning . hicks himself showed relatively little emotion as he received the life-ending news on tuesday , but reporters in court said his eyes filled with tears . his sisters attended the hearing and started sobbing when they heard the decision . hicks ' sister and mother defended him in court on monday , pleading the jury to use mercy in deciding the sentence . however , the 12-person jury , which included eight females and four males , eventually decided on the death sentence after determining that hicks tortured null before she died . in pennsylvania , all capital crimes must include proof of an aggravated circumstance , such as torture . in the middle of their deliberations , a jury member was sent back into court to get the legal definition of torture from the judge . the decision did not appear to be an easy one for the jury , as two members were seen wiping away tears as the sentence was read . hicks ' family were n't the only ones to defend his character in court on monday either , a former cell mate and prison guard testified that he should be spared the death penalty . jerel johnson shared a cell with hicks when he was on trial for murder charge he has since been acquitted of . thought he was in a ` very dark place ' at the time , hicks helped him get through it . a former prison guard who now volunteers to teach bible study classes as a jehovah 's witness says several inmates in his group look to hicks for wisdom . however , those views were countered by a former fiancée who said hicks became a different person when he started abusing drugs and that he once threatened to kill her . hicks ' case is far from over since all death penalties are automatically reviewed by the state supreme court in pennsylvania , which can cancel a death sentence . hicks will formally be sentenced on january 6 .	 charles ray hicks , 40 , was sentenced to death on tuesday for the january 2008 murder of 36-year-old deanna null .   null 's body was found dismembered and strewn the side of pennsylvania interstates , and her severed hands hidden in the walls of hicks ' home .   before he heard his sentence on tuesday , hicks allegedly admitted to killing five other women in texas . 	724

6951	by . mark prigg . researchers have solved the mystery of how massive lakes in the western united states were formed . lakes were able to grow large -- rivaling the great lakes -- during the peak of the last ice age 21,000 years ago , a period known as the ` last glacial maximum , ' the key , researchers discovered , was that evaporation rates were significantly lower than today . during the last glacial maximum , large lakes -lrb- light blue -rrb- covered many of the now dry desert basins of nevada , oregon and california . at the height of the lgm , lake surprise had a surface area of about 390 square miles , roughly the size of san francisco bay . during the last glacial maximum -lrb- lgm -rrb- , giant lakes covered large sections of california , nevada , oregon and utah , including where salt lake city is today . scientists have long been puzzled by how these ancient lakes , now completely dry , grew so large . the prevailing theory was there was more rain and snowfall during this time period . but recent evidence from paleoecology and climate model simulations indicates that precipitation rates were actually relatively low compared to later periods . ` it was previously thought that the lakes grew because there was more rain and snowfall during this period of the earth 's history , ' said daniel ibarra , a graduate student in stanford 's department of environmental earth system science and the first author of the study . during the last glacial maximum -lrb- lgm -rrb- , giant lakes covered large sections of california , nevada , oregon and utah , including where salt lake city is today . earth scientists have long been puzzled by how these ancient lakes , now completely dry , grew so large . the prevailing theory was there was more rain and snowfall during this time period . but recent evidence from paleoecology and climate model simulations indicates that precipitation rates were actually relatively low compared to later periods . to resolve the discrepancy between computer models and the interpretation of geologic evidence , ibarra collected more than 80 samples of tufa -- a limestone created by the evaporation of mineralized water -- from different locations around the edges of lake surprise , a moderate-sized fossil lake in surprise valley , california . the layered shorelines of california 's lake surprise date back to the peak of the last ice age and provide a record of lake level changes over thousands of years . the layered shorelines of california 's lake surprise date back to the peak of the last ice age and provide a record of lake level changes over thousands of years . their findings showed that at the height of the lgm , lake surprise had a surface area of about 390 square miles , roughly the size of san francisco bay . their analyses revealed that 21,000 years ago , the evaporation rate at lake surprise was nearly 40 percent lower than today , with precipitation rates similar to the modern era . more quantitative studies of past climate could help refine the computer models used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- to simulate earth 's atmospheric conditions under changing atmospheric conditions , said kate maher , assistant professor of geological and environmental sciences , who headed the project . ` the ipcc uses climate models to simulate past and future climate , so knowing that some of the models do a better job of simulating past changes gives us more confidence that we understand the physics involved , ' maher said . ` that can give us more confidence in the models we use to simulate future climate change .

2074	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a worker operating a machine in a family workshop in china accidentally cut off his hand -- which doctors were able to save by grafting it onto his lower calf . the worker , xie wei , said he was initially unsure if his right hand could be saved , but he thought it was worth a try . the hand went without a blood supply for many hours while xie searched for a hospital that could perform such a surgery . xie said that he went to local hospitals near the factory first , but he said they told him they `` did not have the skills to help . '' eventually he found a hospital about two hours away where doctors believed they could do it . xie kept his hand in a plastic bag at first , then stored it in a cooler of ice . in total , it took about seven hours to get to a doctor who could help . the doctor , dr. tang juyu , is a specialist in difficult tissue and wound repair cases . before xie went into the operation , tang told him he was optimistic and predicted he would regain the use of his hand , according to xie . tang decided the best way to save the hand was to attach it to xie 's calf where there was a good blood supply . the hand would need to stay there until xie 's arm could fully heal . tang believes there have been about 20 such cases in all of china and all of them have been successful . there is no data , as only case studies have been performed . tang said in a similar operation in 2004 , he grafted a hand onto a patient 's belly . that operation was a success . when xie woke up from the operation he said he was surprised to find his hand on his calf . he says his first reaction at the time was to think it was `` unbelievable '' and `` weird . '' the hand itself felt warm , he said , but it was numb since no nerves were connected and only blood vessels were attached . his leg felt no different , he said , but was `` heavier than usual . '' after about a month his arm was better healed , and he had another surgery where his hand was reattached . tang says this second stage of the operation is actually more challenging , but everything went smoothly . xie has recovered without complications and has been discharged . he is currently resting at home . he said he can twist his wrist to a certain degree , but does n't have full movement with his fingers , at least not yet . doctors told him a full recovery for the nerves in his hand should take about six months . xie said he is n't sure what his future may bring . today he is concentrating on recovering fully . the factory did pay for his operation , which cost about 300,000 chinese yuan , or about $ 49,400 . most of all , xie said , he is thankful to doctors for `` living up to their promise '' that they would be able to reattach his hand and make it functional again . cnn 's april ma and susan wang in beijing contributed to this report .	 man cut off hand at work and searched for a surgeon for 7 hours .   the surgeon attached it to his calf where there was a good blood supply .   there have been about 20 such successful operations in all of china . 	588

4091	-lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.s. ocean , atmospheric and space agencies affirmed on friday what the planet has been telling us every way it knows how : 2014 was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880 . that means average land and sea temperatures , worldwide , have never been hotter in modern times , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- the gold standard for global climate data -rrb- and the national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- the guys who put a man on the moon -rrb- . this is n't about whether we believe in science : it 's about whether we believe the thermometer . in fact , the 16 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1997 , the new data confirm , contributing to widening deserts , rising seas , withering drought , ravaging storms , blistering heat and other climate change impacts reaching from the tiniest african village to our own backyards . here in the united states , arizona , nevada , alaska and california all wrapped up their hottest years on record . california remains mired in the grip of a three-year drought , its worst in centuries . the northeast is still rebuilding from hurricane sandy . and that was just one of the climate-related disasters that cost this country an estimated $ 139 billion in damages in 2012 alone . above and beyond the economic costs , climate change has created a widening humanitarian crisis noted by spiritual leaders around the world . for example , pope francis is expected to publish an encyclical on the state of the world 's environment , singling out climate change as an urgent challenge to global stewardship . it 's reported that he 'll call on people of all faiths to embrace our obligation to protect future generations from this grave and gathering scourge . president obama has embarked on the single greatest u.s. effort yet to combat this growing menace , by reducing the dangerous carbon pollution that 's driving climate chaos . he has directed the environmental protection agency to put in place the first limits on carbon pollution from the power plants that account for about 40 % of the u.s. carbon footprint . under the president 's clean power plan , we 'll cut carbon emissions from our power plants 26 % by 2020 and 30 % by 2030 . we can do better than that -- and we should . the president 's plan puts us on the right track . since last summer , epa officials have been hard at work , coordinating with their state counterparts , public service commissions , power companies and other vested stakeholders to come up with tailor-made plans to hit the targets in the most cost-effective way . some power companies are already well on their way , investing in efficiency so we can do more with less waste , getting more power from the wind and sun , cleaning up dirty power plants or some combination of the three . even as we , as a nation , begin to make progress , though , some coal , gas and oil companies and their allies on capitol hill want to turn us back around . republican leaders in the congress have pledged to lead legislative efforts meant to keep the epa from cutting carbon pollution . the republican leaders are n't offering answers of their own , mind you ; they just want to block any action that could help us address the problem of climate change . it 's part of the big polluter agenda they 've vowed to press , putting fossil fuel profits first -- and putting the rest of us at risk . we have a responsibility in this country to stand up and speak out for what matters most . that 's the essence of american democracy . it 's part of what makes us exceptional . it 's part of what makes us great . we just finished , worldwide , the hottest year on record . those are facts no amount of climate change denial can alter . we have a choice in this country . we can continue to feed climate disaster by anchoring our future in the fossil fuels of the past , or we can protect future generations from the ravages of climate change by investing in the clean energy solutions of tomorrow .	 2014 was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880 .   high temperatures have resulted in widening deserts , rising seas , droughts , ravaging storms , blistering heat .   while president obama is trying to tackle climate change , republicans are blocking meaningful actions . 	749

1515	excessive ? a new report claims that osama bin laden was shot more than a hundred times by navy seals in the 2011 raid . special operations sources have claimed that the terror leader was shot more than one hundred times in the fatal 2011 raid . a new report from a website known within the intelligence and armed services community claims that the sheer number of times that osama bin laden was shot is the reason why the government has never released photos of his dead body . citing two confidential sources , the special operations forces situation report tells how ` operator after operator took turns dumping magazines-worth of ammunition into bin laden 's body ' . the site goes on to argue that while the navy seals may have felt it was ` morally , legally , and ethically appropriate to shoot the body a few times to ensure that he is really dead and no longer a threat , ' that does not justify the extent of this damage . ` what happened on the bin laden raid is beyond excessive . the level of excess shown was not about making sure that bin laden was no longer a threat . the excess was pure self-indulgence , ' author jack murphy writes . at the time of the assassination , president obama and his administration argued that they were justified in never releasing the photos of the dead body or the burial at sea because they could be used as propaganda for al qaeda . the new theories , however , suggest that they are just trying to avoid retribution for allegedly being excessive . scroll down for video . hollywood interpretation : zero dark thirty imagined the events leading to bin laden 's capture . mission : the al qaeda leader was killed at this . compound in abbottabad by u.s. special forces and new reports suggest that the excessive force that was used may be why his death photos have not been released . photos that have been released : images of bin laden , like these which are being used as evidence in the ongoing trial against his son-in-law , have prompted debate among military veterans and good government groups . details about the classified mission were unearthed in seal team six member mark bissonnette 's book which differ from the sofrep account , but murphy writes that bissonnette 's version ` is perhaps the most measured and polite description that one could give ' . in his book , bissonnette does not put a firm number on the amount of bullets used but it sounds far less excessive than the latest reports . ` in his death throes , he was still twitching and convulsing . another assaulter and i trained our lasers on his chest and fired several rounds , ' bissonnette wrote in no easy day which was published in september 2012 . ` the bullets tore into him , slamming his body into the floor until he was motionless . ' incorrect depiction : the latest information suggests the raid of the bin laden compound went down very differently to the events since fictionalized in hollywood in films like zero dark thirty , pictured . his version : mark bissonnette , who was a member of seal team six who was at the raid described them using far fewer bullets to kill the elderly terror leader . tension : the raid of bin laden 's abottabad . compound was watched by president obama and his closest advisers in the . situation room of the white house . murphy argues that the number of bullets used is less of a issue pertaining specifically to this particular case but grows problematic if it represents a changing attitude within the navy seals . ` gone unchecked , these actions get worse over time , ' the army special operations veteran writes . ` the real issue is not that bin laden was turned into swiss cheese , but rather that this type of behavior has become a standard operating procedure in this unit . '	 special ops sources have claimed that the navy seal team unloaded multiple magazines full of ammunition into the dead terror leader 's corpse .   some think the alleged excessive treatment is the reason why the obama administration has not released the ` death photos ' of the al qaeda leader .   white house has always said that any photos of his dead body or sea burial would be used as propaganda by terror cells . 	693

4451	the first frosts of winter have already dusted the spectacular city of st. petersburg with a powder of glistening ice . the air outside feels sharp and crisp . russians hurry along the elegant boulevards , wrapped up tight against the biting cold . russia 's winter , its annual deep freeze , has begun . but this year there 's more than just a bitter chill in the air . for the past nine months relations with the west have become decidedly frosty too . on the face of it the problem is ukraine . the west backed a popular uprising there in march , which toppled a kremlin-friendly government . infuriated , russia 's president , vladimir putin , annexed the strategic crimean peninsula , where it has a key naval base . since then he has been accused of fuelling a separatist rebellion in the mainly russian-speaking east of the country . that unrest has already cost more than 4,000 lives . the united states and europe have imposed costly sanctions and travel bans . it threatens more . on the international stage , russia has been excluded from the g8 group of industrialized nations . at the recent g20 summit in brisbane , president putin was cold-shouldered by his western counterparts . but the russian leader appears unmoved , his ukraine policy unchanged . one fascinating explanation for the failure of western sanctions and rebukes to change this vast country 's behavior may be in the mindset , the world view , of its strongman president . i 'm one of the few western journalists to have sat down with vladimir putin . i met him at his residence outside sochi in 2008 , just after russia 's invasion of georgia . i asked him back then if he could guarantee that russian troops would not invade other former soviet states , like ukraine . he reacted quite angrily , saying he objected to my question . it was russians , he said , who should be given guarantees that no one attacks us . the comment sheds light , i think , on how vladimir putin sees the world outside the walls of the kremlin . for him , russia is under constant threat from the west . nato expansion into former eastern bloc nations has eroded russia 's security . the prospect of georgia joining the western military alliance , let alone ukraine , is unthinkable for him . the cold war , from this perspective , has never really ended ; we 're still living in the 1980s . the west , in particular the united states , still strives to `` subjugate '' russia . president putin repeated this just a few days ago in moscow . sanctions are an inevitable consequence of russia 's resistance to this subjugation . ukraine was the motive , but if it had not been ukraine it would likely have been something else . from a western perspective , this seems like a cynical distortion of the facts , a kremlin ploy to confuse and obfuscate . but it may help explain why russia is doing what it is doing , and why sanctions are not changing -- and may never change -- kremlin policy . it may also help to explain why , at a time of growing economic hardship , russia 's president remains so utterly popular at home . his world view is theirs too . like the harsh cold of the coming russian winter , confrontation with the west is inevitable and must be endured .	 putin accused of fuelling separatist rebellion in mainly russian-speaking east of ukraine .   on international stage , russia has been excluded from g8 group of industrialized nations .   but russian leader appears unmoved , his ukraine policy unchanged .   putin told cnn 's matthew chance : russians should be given guarantees no one attacks us . 	604
8965	like a king with a royal proclamation , the inventor of the gif file format has put an end to all debate over how his invention 's name shall be pronounced . or so he wishes . ` it is a soft `` g , '' pronounced `` jif . '' end of story , ' said steve wilhite . the man who gave the world the quintessential meme-making file type hath spoken . but was there really that much question ? in a word : yes . so says he : steven wilhite , inventor of the gif , accepts a webby lifetime achievement award may 21 . he says his invention is pronounced with a soft ` g. ' once just a part of the jargon of hardcore computer enthusiasts , how to properly say gif has been debated since it was invented in 1987 as a means of neatly compressing images . it has since become synonymous , with the help of a famous dancing baby , with brief and catchy animated images . you need only visit a tumblr page or peruse any buzzfeed article to see how ubiquitous the once nerdy name has become . and you need only run a google search for ` how to pronounce ' to see how active the pronunciation war remains . before you 've even hit the ` g , ' the engine has already guessed what you were thinking . the internet is rampant with websites , blogs , and articles dedicated to the question of how to pronounce the shortened form of graphics interchange format . choosy : an image by the heavy gif users at buzzfeed concurs , likeing the pronunciation to that of the ubiquitous peanut butter . a tumblr dedicated to the question exists , though it comes to no solid conclusion . there is also the gif pronunciation page , which takes the side of mr. wilhite , who purportedly uses the mnemonic device ` choosy developers choose gif , ' to remind everyone it 's a soft ` g ' just like the peanut butter . there 's also a youtube video on the subject . even the president of the united states has taken a stand . when the white house debuted its own tumblr page in april , it posted a graph of what to expect on its new microblog . among the offerings was ` animated gifs -lrb- hard `` g '' -rrb- ' . and that is , if you were wondering , the other way to speak the term . a hard ` g ' like in ` gift . ' partisanship : barack obama , disagrees . the official white house tumblr promises ` animated gifs -lrb- hard `` g '' -rrb- ' but do n't mention that to wilhite . and do n't try to say both are correct , either . ` the oxford english dictionary accepts both pronunciations , ' mr. wilhite said in an email interview with the new york times . ` they are wrong . ' wilhite 's invention has won him much praise over the last 25 years and even more in the last five or so as meme culture has embraced the file as a means of quickly and easily moving messages motivated by everything from comedy to politics across the web . wilhite was even honored tuesday with a lifetime achievement webb award in recognition of inventing the file format . in the words of the official webby website : . ` the proliferation of the gif within today 's meme-powered , tumblr-driven pop culture , proves it a lasting format still among the most celebrated on the web -lrb- despite the hotly contested controversy over its correct pronunciation -rrb- . with 2012 being the 25th anniversary of the gif we think the 17th annual webby awards is a most fitting event to honor and celebrate steve wilhite and this historical achievement . ' brave : but even in the face of tyranny and elitism , the gif 's inventor stands firm . ` the oxford english dictionary accepts both pronunciations ' he said . ¿ they are wrong . ¿ .	 steven wilhite accepted a life time achievement webby award on may 21 for giving the gift of the gif to the world . 	706

2644	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- as they seek solace from the ignominy of a ban from representing their country because of a drinking bout , six australian rugby internationals might just have been served the perfect tonic - knowing that they are not part of the country 's olympic team . a day after a total of 15 players were disciplined for breaching ` internal team protocol ' , the australian olympic committee -lrb- aoc -rrb- issued guidelines about how its own athletes should behave at future games after the consumption of alcohol . there is to be no ` swaying , staggering or falling down ' while rambling or boisterous conversations , annoying team members and difficulty in paying attention to others are also outlawed . while drinking may be permitted outside the olympic village , team members have been left in no doubt as to the expectations now placed upon them . `` these restrictions have been implemented to ensure that australia 's olympic athletes are given the opportunity to compete to the best of their ability and with distinction , '' said a statement bearing the name of aoc president john coates . the failure to comply with these directives , which include the non-consumption of any alcohol in the olympic village , would likely lead to expulsion from the team camp . the first test for australian athletes will come at the winter olympics in sochi in february . the measures came after a 2012 olympic games where some australian athletes were criticized for their drunken behavior at an olympics where the nation collected its lowest medal haul in 20 years . the swimming team 's drunken behavior was particularly frowned upon following an independent review , while a rower was detained by police for damaging shop windows after a drinking session . last week , it was the turn of australia 's rugby players to hit the headlines for their drinking . veteran international adam ashley cooper was one of the six suspended , along with nick cummins , liam gill , tatafu polota-nau , benn robinson and paddy ryan . while the latter will miss the match against wales later this month , the remaining five will all miss this weekend 's clash with scotland . yet the extent of the consumption of what coach ewen mckenzie called `` inappropriate levels of alcohol '' went even further , with a further nine players warned as to their future conduct . `` let 's be clear - these are internal sanctions and are n't a result of any complaints or reports of inappropriate or sinister behavior while our players were out , '' said the former international . `` we 've done this because we need to continually reinforce the need for our players to make smart decisions to benefit the team . `` the worst thing you could do for the wallabies in the long term is nothing , because that would mean we would be ignoring poor culture and a significant performance issue . '' despite the drinking spree , which took place early on wednesday morning of last week , australia defeated ireland 32-15 in dublin three days later , with cummins among the try scorers . several australian rugby players have been involved in drinking incidents in recent times , including james o'connor -- who lost his contract with the national team as a result -- and kurtley beale , who has sought counseling for his problems .	 australian olympic committee issues stringent drinking code .   move comes a day after six australian rugby players were barred for ` inappropriate ' alcohol consumption .   australia 's swimmers and rowers fell foul of alcohol at 2012 olympics . 	586

' mrs booth went on : ` we have campaigned to raise awareness of this issue . ` by failing to ban a driver with more than 12 points on their licence it does undermine the whole system and sends out the wrong message . ` we therefore feel in this instance that the footballer should have faced a ban . ' whitbread failed to earn a new contract with norwich after playing only 18 games in the premier league last season . he made 48 appearances in total for the norfolk club after joining from millwall in january 2010 . it is not the first time a top sportsman has kept his driving licence after using the ` exceptional hardship ' defence . last year champion jockey keiron fallon escaped a ban at lincoln magistrates ' court after arguing he could not afford to add a full-time driver to his entourage . whitbread was fined and ordered to pay costs by jps sitting at norwich magistrates ' court .	 zak whitbread , 28 , was allowed to keep his licence despite having seventeen points .   he claimed he needed to drive to find work at a new club after being released by norwich city in may .   he was caught driving an audi at 97mph on the a14 in cambridgeshire .   magistrates said he came ` very close ' to a driving ban . 	718

' but sir les , in an interview with the times educational supplement , said the focus on universities meant schools risked ignoring vocational courses and apprenticeships which could be better for pupils who should be ` choosing the subjects in which they excel and enjoy ' . he said schools should be encouraging students to take ` the most appropriate route to realise their full potential ' and warned that society ` really undervalues apprenticeships ' . sir les said black and ethnic minority pupils were pressured into applying for medicine and law courses at oxford and cambridge , despite being over-subscribed . sir les added : ` one of our problems is there 's such a dreadful snobbery about whether people go to university or which university they go to . ` i would hate to see that work through into undue pressure on schools . ' he said black and minority ethnic students are put under pressure by their parents to apply for medicine and law courses at oxford and cambridge , despite those courses being some of the most over-subscribed . ` this is one of the reasons that some groups are underrepresented at some universities . we should be treating people as individuals . ` this perceived feeling in our society that to be a doctor or lawyer is a high-status profession that black people aspire to for their children ... there 's nothing wrong with it , but the most important thing is that students should be encouraged to fulfil their full potential in whatever subject that is .

6483	by . jonathan o'callaghan . a pair of trousers found in a chinese graveyard might just be the oldest ever found . the clothing is thought to date back a staggering 3,000 years , and despite the fact the ancient apparel has undergone considerable wear and tear , it still looks remarkably intact . the find was made along with a host of other clothing items in the yanghai tombs in china 's vast tarim basin . what are thought to be the world 's oldest trousers -lrb- pictured -rrb- have been discovered in one of the yanghai tombs in china 's tarim basin . the trousers are made of three bits of cloth , one for each leg and one for the crotch , stitched together . a woven decoration is also visible on the trousers , thought to have been used for horse riding . the trousers , which could actually date up to 3,300 years old , are thought to be the oldest ever discovered . a new paper by ulrike beck and colleagues of the german archaeological institute in berlin suggests the invention of trousers is linked to horseback riding . finds , such as the one reported at the yahghai cemetery , highlight fragments of woollen trousers dating back to the 13th and 10th centuries bc . the age of the trousers corresponds to the known age of horse riding , which is thought to have begun up to 4,000 years ago . ` together with horse gear and weapons as grave goods in both tombs our results specify former assumptions that the invention of bifurcated -lsb- split into two parts -rsb- lower body garments is related to the new epoch of horseback riding , mounted warfare and greater mobility , ' wrote the researchers . ` trousers are essential parts of the tool kit with which humans improve their physical qualities . ' they signify a period when people needed new clothing for horse riding . older clothing such as robes and togas were not suitable for riding , leading to the rise in popularity of trousers . the finding was reported in a paper for the quaternary international . ` this new paper definitely supports the idea that trousers were invented for horse riding by mobile pastoralists , and that trousers were brought to the tarim basin by horse-riding peoples , ' linguist victor mair from the university of pennsylvania told sciencenews . horse riding is thought to have begun up to 4,000 years ago , suggesting that trousers , too , could have originated that far back . the discovery at yanghai were of two men thought to be 40 years-old , wearing the trousers . the clothing suggests they were herders - but they were likely warriors , too . among the items recovered with the men were a whip , a wooden horse bit , a battle-axe and a bow . the find was made along with a host of other clothing items in the yanghai tombs in china 's vast tarim basin . other items have also been found as part of the project known as silk road fashion . these include various garments dating back 3,000 years discovered in eastern central asia . a fur coat -lrb- pictured being analysed by german and chinese scientists -rrb- , is among the finds and each of the relics is said to be of great value . the age of the trousers was estimated using radiocarbon dating and their design , perhaps understandably , was fairly primitive compared to modern standards . in total . the two pairs were each made of three pieces of cloth - one for each leg and one for the crotch . a ` belt ' of sorts had been fashioned from strings , while the garments themselves were decorated with a woven design . the yanghai tombs are a vast ancient cemetery spanning approximately 580,000 square feet -lrb- 54,000 square metres -rrb- . the hot and dry climate in the area known as the tarim basin has helped to preserve corpses , clothing and other artefacts for thousands of years . since digs at the site began in the 1970s , over 500 tombs have been excavated with numerous finds made .	 ancient clothing artefacts have been found in china 's yanghai tombs .   one of the finds includes a pair of trousers , said to be the world 's oldest .   the trousers are thought to signify the rise of horse riding 4,000 years ago .   the primitive trousers themselves date back to up to 3,300 years .   they are made of three pieces of cloth and have a basic design on them . 	717

' ` conventional wisdom says islamists are bent on world domination and this verse is the justification . we found it to be insignificant , ' he said . ` these findings challenge the idea of a clash of civilizations , ' said the study 's lead author jeff halverson , a professor of communication in asu 's college of liberal arts and sciences . ` what extremists are really saying to muslims is , ` our communities are under siege and god will defend us if we have faith and courage . if we try to portray them as evil conquerors when their audience sees them as protectors and champions , it damages our credibility and makes our communication less effective , ' he said . other studies have shown in fact that al qaeda-linked militants are 38 times more likely to kill a muslim than a member of another group -- hardly the activity of a ` competent champion , ' the asu study states .	 controversial study claims qur ` an quotes ` prove ' al qaeda are ` defenders '   islamists are not bent on world domination , claim controversial academics .   ` verse of the sword ' quote used only three times in 2000 texts .   unclear how this fits with extremists violent and unprovoked attacks . 	511

3820	the supreme court has overturned the will of a deceased man who left his entire estate to a hospital after being convinced that his children were not biologically his own . a total of $ 1.8 million worth of estate was left to the royal adelaide hospital research fund by the man , who died in june 2012 and was also known to have repeatedly accused his neighbour of poisoning his plants , according to the supreme court judgement . after one of his daughters challenged the will , the court heard that the father-of-three who emigrated from italy , was often ` aggressive ' and ` hysterical ' and suffered from a ` delusional illness ' which worsened from 1998 onwards . the supreme court of south australia overturned the will of a deceased man who left his entire estate to a hospital . his children recounted to justice tom gray how the 82-year-old often accused his wife of being unfaithful to him and on one occasion , alleged she had been a prostitute and engaged in incest . in 2000 , the judgement records that his wife underwent a lie detector test at the man 's insistence , which she passed . ` the deceased said that these results indicated that the person that administered the test was either dutch or german , and falsified the results of the test as a sign of ethnic unity with his wife , who was born in germany , ' justice gray revealed in his final decision . he had also requested toothbrushes and hair samples from his children on several occasions , before claiming they would be used in dna sample tests to prove that they were not his biological offspring . justice tom gray said in his decision that the man appeared to have ` suffered from delusions at the time that he made the alleged will ' after hearing that he accused his neighbour of poisoning his plants despite his security camera 's showing no evidence . he also accused his wife of being unfaithful and subjected her to a lie detector test . paranoia was also evident in the deceased 's accusations against his former neighbour , who he insisted was poisoning his plants even after relocating to a new home . the allegations continued even after the surveillance camera 's he had installed around his home failed to detect any such behaviour . in the ruling published earlier this month , justice gray wrote that while , ` the deceased 's will , on its face , appears to be properly executed ' the evidence presented ` raises a suspicion that the deceased suffered from delusions at the time that he made the alleged will , and that these delusions influenced his testamentary intentions ' . a settlement was reached between the hospital and the man 's children that would see only $ 200,000 remain with the royal adelaide hospital while $ 85,000 was awarded to his granddaughter and the remainder split between his three children . a settlement was reached between the hospital and the man 's children that would see only $ 200,000 remain with the royal adelaide hospital while $ 85,000 was awarded to his granddaughter and the remainder split between his three children .	 the south australian man left his entire estate to the royal adelaide hospital research fund , a judgement recalls .   his children challenged the will and were awarded the majority of his estate in a settlement approved by the supreme court earlier this month .   they said their father often claimed his wife had been unfaithful to him and that his children were not biologically his own .   in 2000 , he had submitted his wife to a lie detector test which , when she passed , he claimed had been tampered with by a ` dutch or german ' 	552

' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .	 mr evans 's constituency saw one of the biggest swings in history in 1991 .   a by-election saw a tory majority of 19,500 turn into a lib dem majority . 	619

' there was a stir in the assembly hall at hearing the news . ` it is not the new york jets ... and it is not the philadelphia eagles , ' christie continued with the students on tenterhooks . little chat : the governor had already admitted to being a fan of the cowboys -- as well as the more locally acceptable new york mets , knicks and rangers -- back in 2010 . glory supporter ? of course , there are plenty of other reasons why the governor may be a keen supporter of the dallas cowboys ... ` get ready now . my favorite football team are the dallas cowboys ... which by the way is not the smartest thing for the governor of new jersey to want to be is a fan of the dallas cowboys . ' there was uproar in the hall and the students booed loudly . governor christie could only shake his head as he listened in amusement . the governor explained that his father was a giants fan but he grew up a fan of the cowboys and roger staubach . ` the giants and the jets pretty much stunk when i was a kid , ' christie said . ` and my father was a giants fan and i used to remember watching him when i was eight , nine-years-old . every sunday , he would watch the giants and yell at the tv set . i used to think to myself , why would i want to root for a team that makes you angry ? so i decided not to and the cowboys were really good back then . ' christie 's support of an out-of-state team may lead some to question how much he values loyalty in his life . many republicans took issue with the fact that christie met with and praised president obama just days before the 2012 election after hurricane sandy hit . christie , a popular governor widely seen as a possible republican contender in 2016 , frustrated some in the romney campaign who feared he had given what was a critical boost to obama , a democrat . ` if the president of united states comes here and he 's willing to help my people and he does it then i 'm gon na say nice things about him because he 's earned it . ' ` obama provided help to my people at one of the worst crises that this state has ever faced , ' christie added . ` when somebody does a good job , they deserve credit . '	 governor : ` the giants and the jets pretty much stunk when i was a kid , '   ` my father used to yell at the tv set so i followed the giants who were good back then '   will lead many to question christie 's loyalty once again after he backed president obama in the wake of hurricane sandy prior to the 2012 election . 	634

' a third of the school kids questioned said they love learning about history in school and with so much culture on our doorstep it 's important to get kids out and about to experience things first hand . ` it 's not surprising with families under financial pressure that days out and trips away may have suffered .

2270	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- dozens of whales are dead after they got stuck on a remote beach in new zealand , authorities said monday . the 39 long-finned pilot whales became stranded overnight on farewell spit , a narrow claw of land that juts out into the sea from the northern tip of new zealand 's south island . twelve of the whales had died by the time they were found monday morning . conservation officials said they decided to euthanize the remaining 27 because the chances of getting them safely back out to sea were too slim . `` they have come very high onto the beach in a big tide , '' said john mason , the conservation services manager for the area where the whales were found . `` the big tides are now reducing , coming in further out from shore , so it would be difficult to get the large animals into deep enough water to refloat them . '' he said that he and his staff had `` carefully weighed up the likelihood of being able to refloat '' the whales , but that they `` determined that due to various factors it was unlikely they could be rescued . '' `` rather than prolong the suffering of the remaining 27 whales , we decided to humanely euthanize them , '' he said in a statement . surrounded by oceans rich in marine life , new zealand has one of the highest stranding rates for sea mammals in the world . an average of about 300 dolphins and whales get stuck on the country 's coasts each year , according to project jonah , a nonprofit group that aims to rescue and protect marine mammals . golden bay , the area where the group of pilot whales got stuck , is known as a stranding hotspot because of its protruding coastline , gently sloping beaches and system of currents . pilot whales , which live offshore , are among the most vulnerable species to mass strandings in such conditions , according to the encyclopedia of new zealand . but the number of whales that died on farewell spit this week pales in comparison with some of new zealand 's worst strandings . in 1998 , more than 300 pilot whales died after they got stuck in doughboy bay on stewart island , which sits off the south coast of the south island . new zealand 's worst ever stranding took place in 1918 , the encyclopedia of new zealand says , when around 1,000 pilot whales got marooned on long beach in the chatham islands , which are situated hundreds of kilometers off the country 's east coast . scientists ask public to help find missing whales stranded off florida coast . cnn 's khushbu shah contributed to this report .	 the group of whales got stranded overnight on new zealand 's south island .   twelve had died by the morning and officials decided to euthanize 27 others .   `` it was unlikely they could be rescued , '' a local conservation official says .   new zealand has one of the highest stranding rates for marine mammals . 	477

' new family tradition : more families are eating ready meals heated in the microwave . vickie voss , of parragon books , which produces the love food range of cookbooks , said : ` brits have less time to cook but still want to eat and provide good food . ` despite millions of us tuning in to cookery shows , a cookbook still seems the easiest way for people to improve their culinary skills as they can go at their own pace , choose recipes to suit their tastes and enjoy the experience of cooking .

' currently uk pilots are limited to 18 hours without sleep - but more than 4 out of ten pilots -lrb- 43 per cent -rrb- already report nodding off in-flight - of whom a third -lrb- 31 per cent -rrb- awoke to find their co-pilot also asleep , mps heard in evidence . despite this , the department for . transport yesterday insisted the eu blueprint would neither compromise . safety nor increase the risk of pilot fatigue . new transport secretary patrick mcloughlin was accused of ¿ rolling over to brussels ¿ after his department approved the rules . in its official response to the mp 's report published yesterday the department of transport defended its backing of the eu flying hours plan and insisted : ` the government believes that the current draft of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- proposals will not lead to a diminution of safety in the uk . ` the proposals are more conservative than current eu rules which were introduced in 2008 and will result in a significant improvement in safety across the eu as a whole . ' but the british airline pilots ' association -lrb- balpa -rrb- has written to mr mcloughlin urging him to ` think again ' . a balpa spokesman said : ` it is clear that the government has chosen to ignore the concerns of thousands of pilots in the uk . it looks like the government are going to roll over to brussels on this . ` europe want british pilots flying more tired more often . so the government response is extremely disappointing . we hope the new transport secretary will change course . ' the row centres around new rules laid out by the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- which was mandated four years ago by brussels to ` harmonise ' flight time limits and shift-patterns across the eu . since the row erupted , brussels has signalled it may compromise on 20 hours . and despite accepting the new rules the government did accept some of the mp 's findings - including a recommendation to investigate ` the potential under-reporting of pilot fatigue ' . ministers said they would also be seeking a strengthening of specific eu ` fatigue ' rules surrounding flight duties and rest periods and ` stricter limits ' on how frequently airlines could use discretion to exceed maximum levels . transport committee chairman louise ellman , labour mp for liverpool riverside , said of the government 's response : ` there are still areas of concern . the jury 's out . the proof will be in their actions . ' a department for transport spokesman said : ` the safety of the travelling public is paramount and we have been quite clear that we would not support any proposals which the uk 's safety regulator - the civil aviation authority - advise do not provide sufficient protection against crew fatigue . ` we are still awaiting easa 's final proposals , but the caa is satisfied that the latest draft rules now provide a level of safety broadly equivalent to those already in place in the uk .

' the report 's authors attributed the improvement in the academic performances of children with working mothers to the expansion of childcare in the 1990s . professor heather joshi , of the university of london 's centre for longitudinal studies , told the independent : ` there has traditionally been a concern that the employment of mothers comes at the expense of child development . ` but as the percentage of mothers in work has gone up , any impact on children has diminished . ` the most obvious thing that changed in the 90s was the new labour government , which started taking childcare seriously as an area of public concern . ` in the 80s , childcare was either something that only very rich families could purchase or very poor families got offered because their child was at risk , so everyone else in the middle had to make do with informal arrangements . ' the report comes as parliament debates controversial proposals to cut the ratio of childcare workers to children . and prof joshi warned the proposals could reverse the progress evidenced in the report . she added : ` this would n't have happened without a big expansion of childcare and if anything happens to funds available for childcare , there may be consequences . ' sharon hodgson , shadow children 's minister , said the research demonstrated the ` great strides ' labour made in raising the quality of childcare . she added : ` the government 's plans to cut the number of staff needed to look after children risk putting those improvements into reverse . ' the research will be presented in central london today at a campaign for social science event on longitudinal studies attended by universities and science minister , david willetts . on the proposed childcare reforms , a department for education spokeswoman said : ` parents want to be able to go out to work confident in the knowledge that their children are being well looked after . ` quality is central to our childcare reforms which will give parents more choice and ensure their young children have the best start in life .

' a 2009 report in the american journal of public health studied traffic fatalities in the u.s. from 1995 to 2005 and found that more than 12,500 deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits on all kinds of roads . the study also said that rural highways showed a 9.1 per cent increase in fatalities on roads where speed limits were raised , but did not cite specific numbers in those instances . most highways in the u.s. top out at 75 mph , and there are no longer any roads in the u.s. with no speed limit like germany 's autobahn . some highways in rural west texas and utah have 80 mph speed limits . the texas legislature last year approved 85 mph limits for some new stretches of road . the strip of toll road running from austin to seguin , about 35 miles northeast of san antonio , will be the first to allow that speed when it opens in november . the texas transportation commission , which is appointed by gov. rick perry , approved the 85 mph speed limit at a public meeting on august 30 . a transportation department spokesman said commissioners would not comment on their decision . record speeds : map shows top speed limits across the u.s . agency officials had previously said they would study the toll road 's topography , the speeds that most drivers were reaching , and the safety of access points and cross sections before approving the 85 mph speed limit . ` safety is our top priority and tests have shown the designated speed is a safe one , ' agency spokeswoman veronica beyer said . alan guckian , who lives in austin and regularly drives to seguin to visit family , said he 'll likely use the road for convenience and the pleasure of driving fast . ' i would love it , ' guckian said . ` sometimes it 's fun to just open it up . ' steve marcy sometimes uses another part of the toll road on his daily commute from round rock , north of austin , to his job in san antonio . the section he drives now has an 80 mph speed limit . marcy said he 'd be comfortable driving 85 , but would be concerned about others driving vehicles that are not in good condition . ' a tire blowout -lrb- at 85 mph -rrb- could be a big hazard , ' marcy said . chris lippincott , spokesman for sh 130 concession co. that is building the road , said the company is committed to operating a safe highway . ` on any road , drivers hold the key to safety based on traffic , travel conditions and the capabilities of their own vehicles , ' lippincott said . toll prices have not yet been set for the new section . marcy predicted the higher speed limit will attract new drivers , but said most wo n't think it 's worth the cost of the tolls . ` for most people i talk to , it 's a cost issue , ' marcy said .	 will be top speed limit in the united states .   highway safety experts warn could lead to increase in road accidents .   more than 12,500 u.s. deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits between 1995 and 2005 .   the top speed on most highways in the u.s. is 75 .   mph , and there are no longer any roads in the u.s. with no speed limit .   like germany 's autobahn . 	739

3440	fish oil can counter the negative effect junk food has on the brain , say scientists . more than a decade of research has shown that high-fat diets can impact the brain by disrupting ` neurogenesis ' , a process that generates new nerve cells . now university of liverpool researchers have discovered that diets rich in omega-3s , such as fish oil , can prevent these negative effects by stimulating the area of the brain that controls feeding , learning and memory . research : scientists say fish oil can counter the negative effect junk food has on the brain . the team from the university 's institute of ageing and chronic disease originally set out to look at research from across to world to see whether the data suggested that omega-3s had a role to play in aiding weight loss . however , although data from the 185 research papers indicated fish oils do not have a direct impact on this process , it found that they play a significant role in reversing the damage high fats can cause the brain . researcher dr lucy pickavance explained : ` body weight is influenced by many factors , and some of the most important of these are the nutrients we consume . ` excessive intake of certain macronutrients , the refined sugars and saturated fats found in junk food , can lead to weight gain , disrupt metabolism and even affect mental processing . study : diets rich in omega-3s prevent the negative effects by stimulating the area of the brain that controls feeding , learning and memory . ` these changes can be seen in the brain 's structure , including its ability to generate new nerve cells , potentially linking obesity to neurodegenerative diseases . ` research , however , has suggested that omega-3 fish oils can reverse or even prevent these effects . we wanted to investigate the literature on this topic to determine whether there is evidence to suggest that omega-3s might aid weight loss by stimulating particular brain processes . ' the research papers showed that on high-fat diets hormones that are usually secreted from body tissues into the circulation after eating - which protect neurons and stimulate their growth - are prevented from passing into the brain by increased circulation of inflammatory molecules and a type of fat called triglycerides . molecules that stimulate nerve growth are also reduced . but it appears - in studies with animal models - that omega-3s restore normal function by interfering with the production of these inflammatory molecules , suppressing triglycerides , and returning these nerve growth factors to normal . dr pickavance added : ` fish oils do n't appear to have a direct impact on weight loss , but they may take the brakes off the detrimental effects of some of the processes triggered in the brain by high-fat diets . ` they seem to mimic the effects of calorie restrictive diets and including more oily fish or fish oil supplements in our diets could certainly be a positive step forward for those wanting to improve their general health .

3754	hearing : jim davies is suing thames valley police over colleagues ' use of the word ` traveller ' a policeman is suing his bosses after colleagues allegedly offended him by referring to romany people as ` travellers ' . jim davies , an englishman of romany descent , accuses police staff of using the word ` pikey ' to describe other members of the romany community . the speed enforcement officer is suing thames valley police for racial discrimination over the use of the terms . he outlined his case at a preliminary hearing today , where a panel is set to rule which parts of his evidence will be admissable at the full tribunal . the officer , who lives in brackley , northamptonshire , told the hearing in reading that he was offended by hearing romany people described as ` travellers ' . he claimed the term had been ` institutionalised ' at the force over the 20 years he has worked there , and was a discriminatory reference to his own ethnicity . mr davies said he could not remember the details of every alleged use of the word , but insisted that it was used ` on a frequent basis . ' at the preliminary hearing , a section from mr davies ' claim was read out that said : ' i have continuously witnessed colleagues making offensive comments about travellers . ' he also claimed colleagues used the word ` pikey ' as a derogatory term for romany people . a representative of thames valley police argued that the use of the word ` traveller ' referred to the whole community , not just those of romany origin . claim : mr davies insists the word is offensive to romany people and is suing for racial discrimination . james arnold told the panel : ` what we have got is a generic use of the word traveller to describe those people living on traveller sites , regardless of ethnicity . ' however , the claimant is to argue that there were incidents when the term was used in a more specific context when it was likely to refer to romany people . members of the romany community are legally protected from unfair treatment under laws forbidding racial discrimination . the romany people live mostly in europe and the americas and have often suffered from discrimination . police officers regularly make offensive comments about travellers , the employment tribunal heard . mr davies pointed the finger at nine colleagues he accused of making the derogatory remarks but claimed there had been countless insults aimed at travellers during his 20 years as a policeman , amounting to racial discrimination . james arnold , the tvp representative at the tribunal compared the case with a scottish person being offended by the word ` gingers . ' instituionalised : he claimed the term had been ` institutionalised ' at the force over the 20 years he has worked there , and was a discriminatory reference to his own ethnicity . however , jack feeny , representing mr davies , said : ` if everyone in the office is using the word ginger to describe celtics that would be direct discrimination because they are attacking celticism through a code word . ` there will be evidence to show that the use of the term ` traveller ' by thames valley police is synonymous with an ethnic group . ` those police officers were not referring to new age travellers when they made the comments that the complainant complained about . ' mr arnold claimed that as soon as officers gave evidence that they did not know the term traveller related specifically to romany people , the case would collapse . mr davies is seeking compensation for injuries to his feelings by racial discrimination . nine colleagues of pc davies who have had allegations against them and expert witnesses on the use of the word traveller , were expected to be called to give evidence at the full 10-day hearing , which is due to start on june 30 .	 jim davies claims thames valley police staff call romany people ` pikeys '   insists the term ` traveller ' is an offensive reference to his own ethnicity .   the speed enforcement officer is now suing force for ` racial discrimination ' 	690

' while the big six -- british gas , sse , npower , e.on , edf and scottish power -- make profits of around 4 or 5 per cent from supplying energy to households and businesses , they make an average of 22 per cent from generating electricity , sourcing and storing gas , and transporting energy . big firms are also believed to be stockpiling as much as # 2billion in credit from those who pre-pay via direct debit . while firms make around 5 or 6 per cent profit supplying energy into homes , they make nearer 22 per cent for generating power . energy minister greg barker promised to ` come down like a ton of bricks ' on energy providers accumulating cash from householders ' direct debits . a whistleblower at british gas told the observer that the energy giant boosts its own profits by using millions of pounds of credit built up by former customers . the provider has taken # 20million from customers with outstanding credit over the past year . despite huge profits , firms can legally reduce tax bills by exploiting loopholes that allow their owners to lend them money via the channel islands stock exchange . it emerged that scotia gas , uk power networks and electricity northwest avoided paying a total of # 140million in tax by racking up interest on debt to their owners . the chief secretary to the treasury , danny alexander , said on yesterday 's andrew marr show on bbc1 that he was ` livid ' about tax avoidance , adding : ` everybody needs to pay their fair share . ' more than three million older people are worried about staying warm indoors this winter -- with six million anxious about rising fuel bills , says age uk . but the charity said many are unaware of the potentially fatal consequences of living in poorly heated housing .	 angela knight has said that energy profits ` are n't particularly big '   companies making estimated # 36million a year from direct debit interest .   evidence of legal tax avoidance by energy firms has begun to emerge . 	606
2587	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal authorities have charged a trendy santa monica sushi restaurant with serving whale meat -- an investigation that was spurred by the team behind the oscar-winning documentary , `` the cove . '' prosecutors charged typhoon restaurant inc. , the parent company of the hump , and one of its chefs -- kiyoshiro yamamoto , 45 -- with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose . while it is considered a delicacy in japan and some other countries , meat from whale -- an endangered species -- can not be sold legally in the united states . the misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $ 200,000 for the company , said thom mrozek , spokesman for the u.s. attorney 's office . lawyers for typhoon could not be reached for comment . but the restaurant told the los angeles times it accepts responsibility and will pay a fine . the investigation began in october when two members of the team that made `` the cove '' visited the hump , officials said . `` the cove , '' which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a japanese fishing village , won the academy award for best documentary on sunday . the restaurant , located at the santa monica airport , is known for its exotic fare . its web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for `` a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced . '' armed with a hidden camera , the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such , a federal criminal complaint said . a receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as `` whale '' and `` horse '' with the cost -- $ 85 -- written next to them . the women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at oregon state university . he identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale , prosecutors said . the sei is found throughout the world 's oceans . whalers began to hunt them after the population of blue and in whales declined due to overfishing . it is now considered an endangered species . in february and march , the activists returned and again asked for -- and were served -- whale meat , the criminal complaint said . a dna test of the meat smuggled out after the february visit confirmed it to be meat from the sei whale , mrozek said . during the last visit in march , officials with the u.s. customs and border protection , the u.s. fish and wildlife services and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration observed the activists asking for `` kujira '' or whale meat . one of the officers then saw the sushi chef leave the restaurant and return with a wrapped package that he seemed to have retrieved from a parked mercedes , the complaint said . the chef then told a customer it was whale meat , the document said . the next , officials raided the restaurant and chef yamamoto admitted that he had served whale meat , the complaint said . `` someone should not be able to walk into a restaurant and order a plate of an endangered species , '' said u.s. attorney andre birotte jr. . authorities do not yet know where the meat came from . conservation agencies are engaged in an ongoing feud with japan over whaling . in the early 1980s , the international whaling commission determined that there should be a moratorium on commercial whale hunting . whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons , which japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts . the country 's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year . many in the international community believe that such hunts amount to needless slaughter . critics say that japan 's research is actually a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants .	 eatery charged with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for unauthorized use .   meat from whale , an endangered species , can not be sold legally in the united states .   authorities do not yet know where the meat came from . 	714

' he now wants to conduct a much larger trial in the hope it will lead to a ` major change ' in the way tests are done . about one in seven men and one in 12 women over 65 suffer from angina although it is also common in patients in their fifties . it occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed resulting in a heavy , tight pain that can spread to the arms and neck . angina is a form of heart disease and patients may go on to suffer heart attacks and strokes if it is not properly treated . patients are given a spray or pills to take once an attack starts and other drugs to help prevent them .	 angiograms are inaccurate 26 % of the time says professor nick curzen .   professor curzen , a cardiologist , said another procedure is needed .   the results were revealed following a trial involving 200 heart patients .   flawed angiograms result in inappropriate treatment being prescribed . 	475

' the strain , called legionella longbeachae , is found naturally in soil but very rarely causes disease in this country . more than 98 per cent of cases are caused by legionella pneumonophila bacteria . both forms are spread by tiny water droplets in the air . they are not contagious and can be treated with antibiotics if caught early -- but around one in ten cases are fatal . in 2010 , doctors in paisley , scotland , told how a previously healthy 67-year-old man came in to hospital with the rare strain after an eight-day fever . they told the lancet medical journal the man , who survived , was a keen gardener who had cut his index finger while planting with compost . dr martin donaghy , medical director of health protection scotland , said : ` we need to take steps to reduce the risk .

4160	the costs of your airline travel will rise a little today , thanks to the federal government . airline passenger security fees charged by the transportation security administration are increasing because of the congressional budget deal passed in december . the september 11 passenger security fee has traditionally been collected to fund the tsa 's airport security measures , but not this time . most of the new revenue will go to pay down the federal deficit . until monday , a passenger was charged $ 2.50 for each leg of a journey . for a nonstop round trip , the cost was $ 5 . for a round trip with a connection each way , the cost was $ 10 . the fee was capped at two flights each way . that means you could n't get charged more than $ 5 each way or $ 10 round trip , even if you took three flights to get your destination . now , passengers must pay a flat fee of $ 5.60 in each direction , no matter how many plane transfers are made to get from one city to another . for passengers flying a nonstop round trip , that means the fee will increase from $ 5 to $ 11.20 . passengers flying round-trip with a connection each way will see their fees increase $ 1.20 to $ 11.20 per round trip , versus $ 10 before the fee increase . there 's one exception : if you book that terrible trip with a long layover , meaning at least four hours when traveling domestically or 12 hours when traveling internationally , the fees start over . passengers with that much of a stopover between their flights will have to pay another $ 5.60 for the next leg . the tsa 's interpretation of the fee increase has been called into question . though the tsa says the congressional budget deal eliminated caps on these fees , top congressional budget writers say that 's not true . sen. patty murray , d-washington , and rep. paul ryan , r-wisconsin , have written the tsa demanding an explanation . the trade group airlines for america has generally objected to government raising more funds from airline passenger travel and specifically objected to this fee increase and the elimination of the fee cap . `` our government must stop using airlines and their passengers as its own personal atm whenever it needs more money , '' according to a statement . `` a4a strongly opposes tsa 's elimination of the regulatory regime that rejects congressional intent by removing the cap on the tsa fee increase per enplanement as it will disproportionately harm airline passengers who rely on service to small and rural communities . '' who will pay the fee ? though there 's a chance the airlines could absorb some of the cost , do n't bet on it . southwest airlines added the fee to its list of taxes and fees charged to customers starting today . `` effective for bookings starting on july 21 , 2014 , all domestic air carriers are required to implement an increase in the government-imposed september 11th passenger security fee , '' southwest spokesman nick blampye wrote in an e-mail . `` the fee increased from $ 2.50 per segment -lrb- with a maximum of $ 10.00 per round-trip -rrb- to $ 5.60 per one-way trip , '' blampye said . `` southwest customers can view a complete fare breakdown at the time of purchase , which includes the current security fee . '' delta air lines and united airlines , which both declined to comment , also appear to be putting the entire cost on passengers . a flight search monday at delta.com showed a charge of $ 11.20 for a nonstop round-trip flight from atlanta to new york 's laguardia airport . so did a united.com search for a nonstop round-trip flight from atlanta to san francisco . want to comment on the new rule ? although the fee increase goes into effect today , the tsa is accepting public comment through august 19 at regulation.gov . search for `` tsa-2001-11120-0085 . '' electronics to be scrutinized under new tsa security measures .	 congress raised the fee in a budget deal .   most of the money does n't go to back to the tsa .   increase will be $ 1.20 or $ 6.20 for most fliers . 	713

' full up : heathrow airport has less space to expand than rival european hubs . no way : the runway plans have sparked protest by environmentalists . transport secretary justine greening has also said it would be ` difficult ' for her to continue in cabinet if the party went back on its pledge on heathrow . number 10 yesterday confirmed that baa , heathrow 's operator , will be allowed to press its case for a third runway in the forthcoming review , prompting speculation about an impending u-turn . mr goldsmith warned any ` ambiguity ' about the party 's intentions would wreck its hope in a huge swathe of constituencies near heathrow . ` i think if we enter the next election with a manifesto which does not rule out expansion of heathrow i think the conservative party will be very badly defeated in areas beneath the flight path , ' he said .	 mp 's richmond park constituency lies under flight path . 	406

' panera also is n't swearing off genetically modified ingredients , another issue that is gaining attention in certain circles . unlike chipotle , which says its menu will soon be free of gmos , panera uses too many different ingredients to be able to make that claim . and neither chain has any plans to stop selling fountain sodas from coca-cola and pepsico , even though the drinks are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup . as for the rest of its menu , panera says it 's about halfway through the removal of artificial ingredients . it 's still looking for ways to removes the artificial colors used in its bakery icings , for instance , and is testing a smoked ham in select markets that does n't use artificial preservatives . growing trend : the latest move comes as several other like-minded chains ¿ including chipotle and starbucks ¿ also have pushed to reduce artificial additives . ` we decided it was time to put all this into a clear and concise policy , ' ron shaich , panera 's founder and ceo , said in an interview . ten years ago , for instance , panera announced that it would use chicken raised without antibiotics , a move shaich said helped significantly drive sales . panera 's new policy also states the chain 's commitment to ` transparency , ' meaning it will make it easy for people to see the ingredients and nutritional content of its food . it also says it will work to have a ` positive impact ' on the food system , such as by supporting north american suppliers whenever possible . whether the new policy helps attract more customers is yet to be seen . last year , panera 's sales rose 2.6 percent at company-owned locations open at least a year . that was down from 6.5 percent in 2012 and 4.9 percent in 2011 . this year , the st. louis-based company is forecasting sales growth of 2 to 3.5 percent .	 pledge made to remove artificial colors , .   flavors , sweeteners and preservatives .   the latest move comes as several other like-minded chains , including chipotle and starbucks , also have pushed to reduce artificial additives . 	759

4652	former arkansas governor and presidential hopeful mike huckabee sparked outrage across the country this week for his offensive remarks about women and birth control . but the real problem is n't what he says -- it 's what he and too many other politicians believe , and it 's the policies they would advance if they have the chance . in a speech to the republican national committee , huckabee said that it was wrong to give women access to no-co-pay birth control under the affordable care act -- that by doing so , women were being told `` they are helpless without uncle sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they can not control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of government . '' of the thousands of types of medical care covered by insurance companies -- somehow he and a lot of other politicians have focused like a laser on birth control -- on taking coverage away from women . indeed , huckabee 's remarks were no `` gaffe , '' as too many pundits have called them . this is a speech he 's made before , and his remarks are a look inside the playbook of politicians who appear to have no idea how birth control works and why it 's so important to millions of women as a basic , preventive health care . they ignore the fact that women use birth control for a whole host of medical reasons -- and that 's their business , not mike huckabee 's . in huckabee 's vision , every boss in america would be empowered to decide whether his or her female employees should have access to birth control the way they do for any other prescription medication . huckabee is joining a battle being waged cross the country . over 40 for-profit companies have filed lawsuits against the birth control benefit of the affordable care act , and the supreme court will hear arguments in two of those cases in march . if the court rules in favor of the for-profit companies , employers for the first time ever could have the right to dictate to their employees the type of health care they may have access to . meanwhile , 20 state legislatures have moved to exempt certain employers and insurers from allowing their employees access to birth control without a co-pay . in kansas , pharmacists are allowed to refuse to fill a prescription for birth control if they have a moral objection -- even if there 's no other pharmacist in the area that a woman can go to instead . and while the states are individually waging separate battles , on the national front the u.s. house of representatives approved an amendment a few months ago to roll back the birth control benefit . the politicians behind these moves disregard how important birth control is for women and families . it allows women to take control of their health and economic security and to take personal responsibility for their family planning decisions . many women also need birth control for medical reasons . for example , it can help relieve painful menstrual cramps , and help avert infertility by addressing the symptoms of endometriosis . access to birth control is also an economic issue . until now , the cost has been expensive , with many women paying an average of $ 600 a year -- but sometimes much more -- for contraceptive protection . the affordable care act enables 27 million women to receive their prescription birth control without a co-pay . birth control also allows women , who make up nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers , to remain in the labor force . for a woman working for minimum wage at a retail store , or for tips at a restaurant , the birth control benefit is tremendously important . for many women , it means the difference between taking birth control regularly and not being able to -- between getting pregnant and not getting pregnant . as we look toward the midterm elections later this year , it 's increasingly clear that access to birth control will be on the ballot . mike huckabee 's remarks this week underscore what 's at stake -- and why women will not allow out-of-touch politicians to take us back to the 1950s .	 cecile richards : mike huckabee caused uproar with clueless comments about birth control .   he said women told they need goverrnment `` uncle sugar '' to pay for their birth control .   richards : his words show political agenda to deny women contraceptive coverage .   richards : birth control key in women 's lives , health . next election , issue will be in balance . 	743

2003	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it 's easy to understand why comedians like jim carrey , mike myers , and sacha baron cohen have flirted with adapting james thurber 's 1939 new yorker story about a timid man with a vibrant fantasy life . not only has cgi made it relatively simple to turn walter mitty 's daydreams into technicolor tapestries of digital eye candy , it 's also the kind of emotionally textured role that can be a springboard out of the banana-peel slapstick ghetto . ben stiller 's no stranger to such clown-crying-on-the-inside gambits -lrb- see : `` permanent midnight '' and `` greenberg '' -rrb- . but his new film , `` the secret life of walter mitty , '' despite all of its visual razzle-dazzle , never locates the beating heart of its hero . stiller , who also directed , plays mitty as an absentminded , socially awkward nebbish who works in the photo department at life magazine . the irony , of course , is that even though he works at a place called life , he has n't lived . instead , he retreats into his head and imagines himself a dashing mountain climber or a hot-blooded casanova . stiller and screenwriter steven conrad have given thurber 's story a 21st-century twist by setting the film in our era of corporate downsizing . life is about to cease publishing , and for its final cover the editors have chosen a shot from their globe-trotting photojournalist star , sean o'connell -lrb- sean penn -rrb- . then mitty misplaces the negative . and with the encouragement of a co-worker he 's sweet on -lrb- kristen wiig -rrb- , he embarks on a quest to find o'connell , leading him to greenland and the himalayas . as stiller 's mitty crisscrosses the planet , he slowly transforms into the action hero he 's always been in his fantasies . while stunning sequences show him skate-boarding away from an erupting volcano and fighting off a great white shark , the character never becomes more than a fuzzy conceit . at the risk of psycho-analyzing a film that 's already too deep inside its own head , stiller seems to lack the confidence as a dramatic actor to fully commit to the emotional potential of his story . too often he aims at our funny bones when he should be targeting our heartstrings . in the end , walter mitty is a film about acting out our dreams . but stiller never quite shows us the soul of his dreamer . b - . see the original story at ew.com . click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly . © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. . all rights reserved .	 ben stiller plays the title character in `` the secret life of walter mitty ''   the movie is an adaptation of a 1939 james thurber story .   while there are some visually stunning sequences , the film never quite comes to life . 	466

' i do n't know , ' he said . ' i need to think about it . we 're in the middle of the season and i 'm just getting on with it . ' asked again , he replied : ` at some point i am going to have to think about the future , but at the moment my focus is getting in front of the silver car -lrb- the mercedes -rrb- . ' christian horner , his boss at red bull , was firmer but not conclusive when he responded by saying : ` it is an annual thing that there is speculation about adrian 's future but he has made his feelings clear to me about the team . in the pits : ferrari chief luca di montezemolo salutes the fernando alonso faithful in spain . ` he has paternal feelings towards the team and he is much more involved than he has been . the speculation is purely that . you can understand why ferrari would be looking . adrian has always enjoyed a challenge . ' newey , who still designs by hand on a sketch board , enjoys his life at red bull : the atmosphere is relaxed -lrb- but highly competitive -rrb- , with a college-like air in his design department . it was that freedom , plus plenty of money , that convinced him to leave mclaren and its straitjacket approach to join the milton keynes factory and build four world championship-winning cars . those working practices were sold to him by horner over dinner at the bluebird restaurant on chelsea 's king 's road . red bull are struggling this year but that is down to their under-powered renault engines rather than newey 's chassis . there is no sign of any strain in relations between newey and his team . it is more a matter of whether he is tempted to take on a new , perhaps final , challenge in formula one at the age of 55 . ferrari is alluring to anyone with racing in their soul .	 adrian newey 's services are sought by ferrari chief luca di montezemolo .   newey was behind a combined 20 titles at williams , mclaren and red bull .   ferrari have parted company with team principal stefano domenicali .   a move to ferrari could signal newey 's final challenge in formula one . 	653

8817	genius : alan turing , who certainly earned his stripes in the scientific world . for the first time experimental evidence has been put forward confirming great british mathematician alan turing 's theory of how biological patterns such as tiger stripes or leopard spots are formed . turing , whose centenary falls this year , put forward the idea that regular repeating patterns in animals are generated by a pair of morphogens that work together as an ` activator ' and ` inhibitor ' . now researchers from king 's college in london have validated the famous code-breaker 's 60-year-old theory in tests that also advance regenerative medicine . to test the theory the researchers studied the development of the regularly spaced ridges found in the roof of the mouth in mice . carrying out experiments in mouse embryos , the team identified the pair of morphogens working together to influence where each ridge will be formed . these chemicals controlled each other 's expression , activating and inhibiting production and therefore controlling the generation of the ridge pattern . the researchers were able to identify the specific morphogens involved in this process -- fgf or fibroblast growth factor , and shh , which stands for sonic hedgehog -- so-called because laboratory fruit flies lacking the fly version have extra bristles on their bodies . cat 's amazing : tigers have stripes because of the behaviour of specific morphogens . turing was one of the great unsung heroes of world war ii . he broke the german military 's secret codes - created using the famous enigma machine - that helped british intelligence stay one step ahead of hitler , allowing the navy to defeat his u-boats and win the battle of the atlantic . turing 's work even laid the foundation for the creation of modern computers , leading time magazine to name him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century . ` everyone who taps at a keyboard , opening a spreadsheet or a wordprocessing program , is working on an incarnation of a turing machine , ' it said . but turing was shamefully ignored by the british establishment , and then killed himself in 1954 after being convicted of being a homosexual and forced to undergo hormone therapy . they showed that when these morphogens ' activity is increased or decreased , the pattern of the ridges in the mouth palate are affected in ways predicted by turing 's equations . for the first time the actual morphogens involved in this process have been identified and the team were able to see exactly the effects predicted by turing 's 60-year-old speculative theory . dr jeremy green from the department of craniofacial development at king 's dental institute said : ` regularly spaced structures , from vertebrae and hair follicles to the stripes on a tiger or zebrafish , are a fundamental motif in biology . t . ` there are several theories about how patterns in nature are formed , but until now there was only circumstantial evidence for turing 's mechanism . our study provides the first experimental identification of an activator-inhibitor system at work in the generation of stripes -- in this case , in the ridges of the mouth palate . ` although important in feeling and tasting food , ridges in the mouth are not of great medical significance . however , they have proven extremely valuable here in validating an old theory of the activator-inhibitor model first put forward by alan turing in the 50s . ` not only does this show us how patterns such as stripes are formed , but it provides confidence that these morphogens -lrb- chemicals -rrb- can be used in future regenerative medicine to regenerate structure and pattern when differentiating stem cells into other tissues . ` as this year marks turing 's centenary , it is a fitting tribute to this great mathematician and computer scientist that we should now be able to prove that his theory was right all along ! ' results of the study were published this week in nature genetics .	 alan turing 's 60-year-old theory is validated . 	694

4788	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush on wednesday signed the economic stimulus act of 2008 , calling it a `` booster shot '' for the american economy . `` the bill i 'm signing today is large enough to have an impact , amounting to more than $ 152 billion this year , or about 1 percent of the gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- , '' the president said in the brief ceremony in the east room of the white house . the government hopes the measure , which will send most americans tax rebate checks by may , will either prevent a recession or make one relatively brief . the package also includes tax breaks for equipment purchases by businesses , as well as payments to disabled veterans and some senior citizens . the bipartisan measure moved through congress at relative break-neck speed , going from initial discussions to enactment in less than four weeks . the package will pay $ 600 to most individual taxpayers and $ 1,200 to married taxpayers filing joint returns , so long as they are below income caps of $ 75,000 for individuals and $ 150,000 for couples . there is also a $ 300 per child tax credit . watch bush sign stimulus bill into law '' the rebates will put about $ 120 billion in the hands of individuals in the hope that they will spend it and boost a faltering u.s. economy . economists generally agree that the economy should see a boost from the rebate checks . but most also agree that the full impact will be less than the total value of the stimulus package . that 's because some recipients are expected to save their rebates or use them to pay down credit cards or other debt instead of spending it . in addition , some consumers may spend their rebates on imported items , which would provide a more limited lift to the u.s. economy . `` my guess is that of the $ 110 billion to $ 120 billion of tax rebates , about half will go to u.s. products and services , '' said david wyss , chief economist for standard & poor 's . there also are questions about whether the stimulus will actually be the key to ending or preventing a recession . treasury secretary henry paulson said last week that the internal revenue service planned to send the rebate checks to about 130 million americans . `` they 're going to be getting ready to get checks out , and believe me , they will . ... and this is largely going to be done by the time summer 's over . and so we 're going to move quickly and make a difference , '' he said . bush praised the quick work of the house and senate and urged americans not to `` overreact '' to the current economic troubles . `` in the past seven years , the system has absorbed shocks : recession , corporate scandals , terror attacks , global war ; yet the genius of our system is that it can absorb such shocks and emerge even stronger , '' he said . `` in a dynamic market economy , our economy will prosper and it will continue to be the marvel of the world .

'' more seriously , obama thanked the scientists for devoting their lives to the cause of exploration outside our planet . `` what you 've accomplished embodies the american spirit , '' he said . `` our expectation is that curiosity is going to be telling us things that we did not know before , '' he said , and that the rover will lay the groundwork for an even more `` audacious undertaking , '' which would be `` a human mission to the red planet . '' what we 've done on mars , and what 's next . curiosity is about the size of a sport utility vehicle and weighs 2,000 pounds . the mission costs about $ 2.6 billion . the rover , after traveling for more than eight months , safely landed on the surface of mars before 2 a.m. e.t. on august 6 . the landing process was dubbed `` seven minutes of terror '' and involved the world 's largest supersonic parachute and a sky crane . despite the complicated landing mechanism , the rover landed about 1.5 miles from its target , which was still well within the range where scientists expected it to arrive . `` it 's really mind-boggling what you 've been able to accomplish , '' the president told the nasa mission specialists . `` and being able to get that whole landing sequence to work the way you did is a testimony to your team . '' 5 reasons to be excited about curiosity . the rover will head toward mount sharp , a 18,000-foot high mountain about 7.5 miles south of where it landed . curiosity will climb at least a small portion of this mountain , which is composed of layers of rock that have built up over time . using its science tools , the rover will test for organic molecules , which would indicate the planet could have once hosted life . meet a rover driver : his other car is on mars . curiosity is supposed to last for two years on the red planet , but previous missions suggest that it could go longer . nasa had planned for twin rovers spirit and opportunity to last only 90 days , but spirit persevered from 2004 to 2010 , and opportunity is still chugging along . obama may be busy with the upcoming election , but he said he 'd still like to know immediately whether curiosity finds life -- even microorganisms -- on mars . `` if in fact you do make contact with martians , please let me know right away , '' he said , receiving more laughter . he added , `` i 've got a lot of other things on my plate , but i suspect that that will go to the top of the list .

'' attempts to reach charles on thursday were unsuccessful . he declined to comment when seen outside his indianapolis home by a reporter with cnn affiliate wxin . the alleged scheme began to unravel when the executive director of the museum , mary ellen hennessey nottage , received a call last month from a man in california who said he had purchased `` six jars of brain matter '' for $ 600 on ebay , according to court documents . the man suspected the jars were stolen when he compared them to others on the museum website . nottage notified the police . nottage said the california man collected oddities . the specimens he bought were stolen from a warehouse space on the museum campus , where thousands of jars of brain and other human tissue from autopsies performed on patients at the now-defunct central indiana hospital for the insane in the 1890s were stored . `` apparently that 's a trend that 's building -- the macabre , the oddities , '' nottage said . `` the television reality show ` oddities ' illustrates that very well . i think it 's indicative of people 's collecting interests . it 's definitely bizarre . it 's infuriating that they do not have respect for the human remains .

4207	thai anti-government demonstrators massed wednesday outside the prime minister 's makeshift office , a day after clashes with police in the streets of bangkok killed five people . the protesters have been rallying in the city for months , demanding that prime minister yingluck shinawatra step down . their long-running campaign has deepened political divisions in thailand , undermined the functioning of the national government and stirred outbreaks of deadly violence . the demonstrators want to rid the country of the influence of yingluck and her older brother , former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who they say controls the government from self-imposed exile . they are calling for the creation of an unelected `` people 's council '' to oversee electoral and political changes . 10 questions : what 's behind the protests in thailand ? deadly clashes . with thailand still scarred by a severe bout of civil unrest in 2010 -- in which a crackdown on pro-thaksin protesters by security forces left scores of people dead -- police had until recently largely refrained from using force on the current demonstrations . but last week , police began attempts to clear sites occupied by protesters for months . government officials said the protesters ' actions were blocking public access to government services . the police measures encountered strong resistance from protesters in central bangkok on tuesday , and clashes between the two sides erupted into gun fire . five people , including a police officer , died in the violence , and more than 70 were wounded . police have suspended efforts to seize the protest sites for the time being , said lt. gen. paradon patthanathabut , the national security chief . protesters gather . the anti-government protesters , meanwhile , are trying to keep up the pressure on yingluck by gathering wednesday outside defense secretariat offices in the suburbs of bangkok where the prime minister has set up a temporary office . she has had to relocate there after the demonstrators blocked access to government house , the office of the prime minister and appointed cabinet ministers in central bangkok . thousands of demonstrators assembled near the defense secretariat compound , arriving by foot , on bikes and in pick-up trucks . some of them waved flags and others blew whistles , a trademark of their movement . about 1,000 police officers in riot gear were positioned outside the compound . it was n't immediately unclear whether yingluck was inside the offices wednesday . she gave a televised speech from there on tuesday . political uncertainty . the prime minister is also facing difficulties over her government 's controversial rice subsidy program . thailand 's anti-corruption commission said tuesday it was bringing charges against yingluck over allegations she failed to act on warnings of corruption in the program , which paid farmers well above the market rate for their rice but has run into financial problems . yingluck said tuesday that the program had been successful and that there was `` no conspiracy to corrupt . '' the current protests in bangkok were sparked in november by yingluck 's government 's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother 's return to the political fray in earnest . yingluck called elections in december in the hope that they wcould help ease tensions . but the main opposition party boycotted the vote earlier this month , and protesters caused widespread disruption , making the outcome of the election inconclusive . that has left yingluck 's caretaker administration unable to operate fully .	 demonstrators assemble outside the prime minister 's temporary office .   thousands of them arrive on foot , on bikes and in pick-up trucks .   clashes between demonstrators and police left five people dead on tuesday .   the protesters have been campaigning against prime minister yingluck shinawatra . 	603

' smith , a first-round 1990 draft pick of the raiders , then based in los angeles , and an 11th pick overall for the national football league that year , played all seven seasons of his nfl career for the raiders , first in los angeles and then in oakland . evans said he was informed of the new charges just 45 minutes before jury selection was set to begin on monday in the retrial of the original case charging smith with murder in the october 2008 slaying of an associate named maurilio ponce . piling on : the charges against the former athlete , pictured in 1992 , incorporate an original murder case dropped against him and the kidnap-killings of three other men - one in 1999 and two in 2001 . the first jury deadlocked 8-to-4 in favour of a guilty verdict , leading to a mistrial . the latest felony complaint charges smith with three additional counts of first-degree murder in connection with the november 1999 slayings of brothers kevin and ricky nettles , and the june 2001 killing of dennis henderson . according to gibbons , the nettles brothers were abducted from a car wash in los angeles by two individuals posing as police officers and were found shot to death the next day . about 19 months later , henderson and another man , terry ware , were kidnapped in los angeles by several armed suspects , placed in separate cars and driven away . ware was freed but henderson 's body was found in the back of a rental car the next day . he had been beaten and stabbed to death , gibbons said . pleas : smith , pictured during his first murder charge that was dropped , plans to plead not guilty to all four counts against him . gibbons said she had no further information about a possible motive or circumstances behind the killings . she said prosecutors would decide later whether to seek the death penalty against smith . homicide detectives assigned to the case were not immediately available for comment . smith was charged in february 2011 along with two other men in connection with the slaying of ponce , who was found shot to death on a remote roadside in lancaster , california , north of los angeles , on oct. 7 , 2008 . the defense has acknowledged that smith and ponce were once involved together in a cargo theft , and that smith was seen driving ponce 's car a month after he was slain . but evans has insisted that his client had nothing to do with ponce 's murder and argued during the trial that police lacked any physical evidence , such as dna , fingerprints or gunpowder residue , linking him to the crime . he said ponce had given smith his car when ponce stopped being able to make payments on it . evans said he could not comment in detail about the three additional slayings because he had not yet seen evidence that prosecutors will be required to share with him .	 anthony wayne smith charged with four counts of first-degree murder .   newly accused of kidnap-killings of three men in 1999 and 2001 .   murder trial in 2008 ended in hung jury . 	750
3202	education secretary michael gove 's flagship free school programme was rejected as ` problematic ' by the catholic church yesterday . greg pope , deputy director of the catholic education service -lrb- ces -rrb- for england and wales , said there was a ` perverse disincentive ' for the church to launch free schools . free schools are state schools set up by parents , teachers , charities , faith groups and other organisations . rejected : the flagship free school programme of education secretary michael gove , pictured left , was called ` problematic ' by the catholic education service deputy director greg pope , right . a department for education document for . groups applying to open free schools with a religious character says . that admission on the basis of faith must be limited to 50 per cent of . the yearly intake when oversubscribed . mr pope said this 50 per cent issue ` works against there being a huge number of catholic free schools ' . at the moment there is only one catholic free school , st michael 's catholic school in truro , cornwall . mr pope said : ` when i discussed this with the secretary of state earlier in the summer , the point i made to mr gove was we would be unlikely to open a new school unless there was demand for a new school . ` if there was demand for a new 1,000-pupil catholic school , why would we open a free school if we had to turn away pupils on the grounds that they are catholic while accepting others on the grounds that they are not catholic ? that 's a perverse disincentive to me . ' mr pope said he was not against the idea of free schools and it was an option they would explore further if this ` barrier ' was not in the way . he said the catholic church does have the option of opening up voluntary aided -lrb- va -rrb- schools -- state schools run by a foundation or trust , quite often a faith group . but if they wanted a new school to be an academy -- which has more freedom than local council-run schools -- they would have to open a va school and convert . his comments came as the ces published its annual census looking at the make-up of its schools . it found that 70.4 per cent of pupils at catholic schools in england and wales belong to the catholic faith , along with 55 per cent of teachers . it also found that some 33.5 per cent of pupils at catholic primary schools are from an ethnic minority , along with 28.7 per cent of those at catholic secondary schools .	 the catholic education service for england and wales said there was no incentive for church to start up free schools .   currently only one catholic free school , st michael 's catholic school in truro , cornwall . 	468

4219	americans are generally excited about the new technology they expect to see in their lifetimes . but when confronted with some advances that already appear possible -- from skies filled with drones to meat made in a lab -- they get nervous . those are the findings in a report released thursday by the pew research center , which sought to gauge public opinion about our rapidly changing world of science and tech . `` the american public anticipates that the coming half-century will be a period of profound scientific change , as inventions that were once confined to the realm of science fiction come into common usage , '' reads the report . overall , respondents to pew 's survey were upbeat about how technology will shape the near future . in the report , 59 % of americans think tech developments will make life in the next half-century better , while only 30 % said they will make life worse . more than eight out of 10 respondents -lrb- 81 % -rrb- said they think that in the next 50 years , people who need transplants will be able to get them with organs grown in labs . and more than half -lrb- 51 % -rrb- think computers will be able to create art as skillfully as humans do . they 're a little less optimistic about some science-fiction staples , though . only 39 % think it 's likely scientists will have figured out how to teleport things -lrb- or , presumably , people -rrb- , 33 % say we 'll have long-term space colonies by 2064 and a mere 19 % expect humans will be able to control the weather . interestingly , some of the advances that may be closest to becoming reality are the ones survey respondents were most worried about . nearly two out of three americans think it would make things worse if u.s. airspace is opened up to personal drones . a similar number dislike the idea of robots being used to care for the sick and elderly , and of parents being able to alter the dna of their unborn children . meanwhile , only 37 % of respondents think it will be good if wearable devices or implants allow us to be digitally connected all the time . with the advent of google glass and other wearable technology , that may not be such a distant dream . and already , researchers are developing robots to provide elder care , 3d printers are replicating parts of the human body and government regulators are considering allowing nonmilitary drones to legally operate in u.s. airspace . `` in the long run , americans are optimistic about the impact that scientific developments will have on their lives and the lives of their children -- but they definitely expect to encounter some bumps along the way , '' said aaron smith , a senior researcher at pew and the author of the report . `` they are especially concerned about developments that have the potential to upend long-standing social norms around things like personal privacy , surveillance , and the nature of social relationships . '' other responses shined a light on what may be our cautious human nature . while generally excited about future tech , many survey participants were n't so keen on testing out those advances themselves . people were split almost evenly -lrb- 48 % -50 % -rrb- on whether they would ride in a driverless car . but only 26 % said they 'd get a brain implant to improve their memory or intelligence , and a mere 20 % said they 'd try eating meat made in a lab . while they were imagining the future , pew gave respondents the chance , in their own words , to share the one piece of futuristic technology they 'd most like to own . some 9 % said they 'd like to be able to time travel . a similar number said they 'd like something that would keep them healthy or extend their lives , 6 % said they wanted a flying car -lrb- or bike -rrb- , 3 % said they 'd take a teleportation device and a mere 1 % said they want their own jetpack . the report was based on telephone interviews conducted february13-18 with 1,001 adults from all 50 u.s. states and the district of columbia .	 survey : many americans are wary of futuristic tech advancements .   drones , robot nurses and always-on devices concern people .   but 59 % still think tech developments will make future life better .   nearly 1 in 10 say they 'd most like to be able to time travel . 	745

' dr priest and his team discovered three years ago that a fungal pathogen made fruit flies live 14 per cent longer by activating the same ` stress ' and ` immunity ' genes which responded to fasting in humans . but for the last year they have used 30,000 flies to discover that the same flies become 20 per cent more likely to catch an infection than flies which were not exposed to the life-lengthening fungus . he said more work needs to be done to establish why and how extreme diets leads to more infections . he added : ` this is the aspect that people have n't studied . ` we know that when we have friends that go on crazy diets there can be massive changes in physiology . ` there is lots of evidence to say that in ideal condition animals live much longer with restricted diets calorie intakes , but our study shows there is a good reason for that - the trade off for that occuring is the suppressing of the immune system . '	 experts at the university of bath found fasting diets increased the risk of infection by 20 per cent .   previous studies have found the 5:2 diet helps with weight loss , longer lifespans and lowering blood pressure . 	603

'' blatter 's presidential rival vows reform . bin hammam , who has been at the summit of asian football since 2002 , also said greater transparency is needed among the game 's decision makers . fifa became mired in controversy ahead of their decision to award the 2018 and 2022 world cups to russia and qatar respectively , with two executive committee members -- amos adamu and reynald temarri -- suspended amid allegations of selling votes . `` people would like to see transparency within fifa , '' said bin hamman . `` fifa is always accused of corruption and it is not -lrb- corrupt -rrb- . what is missing , and lacking , is transparency which over the years we could not provide to the public . '' a qatar native , bin hammam also defended the emirates ' conduct during the bidding process for the 2022 tournament . `` qatar played the game according to the law of the game . people were not happy , but people will not be happy with so many decisions taken by fifa . `` i do n't think people were happy about russia winning the right to host 2018 . now is not the time to cry about something that happened in the past . let us hope the future is going to be more transparent and more open for the public . '' blatter -- the eighth incumbent of fifa 's top job -- was this month boosted by the news the 2010 world cup had made the non-profit organization $ 3.655 billion and said he was not expecting to be challenged in the forthcoming elections . blatter : 2010 world cup was a huge financial success . however , bin hammam announced he would compete for the role of fifa chief on march 18 and has not spoken with blatter since . `` not since i announced i was running , i spoke to him maybe two weeks back . `` i hope mr. blatter realizes our game is about competition and there is nothing wrong with competing . i hope we will understand that competition does not mean we are enemies . '' meanwhile , frenchman michel platini has been re-elected unopposed as president of european football 's governing body uefa on tuesday . the 55-year-old former european player of the year will serve a second mandate of four years , having first been elected in 2007 when he took over from lennart johansson .	 sepp blatter will step down as fifa president in 2015 , if elected for another term .   his presidential rival mohammed bin hammam has said it is time for a change .   bin hammam is blatter 's first election opponent since issa hayatou in 2002 .   the vote for the fifa presidency will take place in zurich , switzerland on june 1 . 	723

2104	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- last night 's shooting rampage at a movie theater in aurora , colorado , was a nightmare . authorities have already arrested a suspect . four weapons were recovered in the shooting scene , including a shotgun and two handguns . twelve people have been killed , with many more injured . according to law enforcement officials , the weapons were purchased legally by the suspect in the last six months . the shooting was senseless . and it makes us think once again about how we can address the horrific problem of gun violence in america . the first task is conceptual -- can we figure out what will work ? the second task is political -- can plausible solutions be implemented legislatively ? opinion : gun control wo n't stop mass murder . the conceptual problem is immensely difficult , especially in a society that is already as gun-saturated as america is today . the political problem borders on the impossible . gun policy in this country is made by the national rifle association , and no serious effort at gun control can currently get past its veto . even when legislation passed during the clinton years in the form of the brady bill , requiring background checks at the time of gun purchases , or the assault weapons ban , the nra succeeded in injecting gaping loopholes into the laws . who needs to go through a background check at walmart when you can get your gun without one at the local gun show or from some shady figure on a street corner ? the assault weapon ban only prohibited the manufacture of new guns -lrb- it grandfathered in a huge cache of pre-existing weapons -rrb- and gun manufacturers easily redesigned their guns to circumvent the ban . the nra then trumpets how `` gun control '' does n't work . but it can . commenters debate guns , ` what if ' consider what happened in australia after a crazed gunman killed 35 people in port arthur , tasmania , in 1996 . the australian federal government persuaded all states and territories to implement tough new gun control laws . under the national firearms agreement -lrb- nfa -rrb- , firearms legislation was tightened throughout the country . national registration of guns was imposed and it became illegal to hold certain long guns that might be used in mass shootings . the gun ban was backed up by a mandatory buy-back program that substantially reduced gun possession in australia . ireporter : ` ak-47 a weapon for war ' the effect was that both gun suicides and homicides -lrb- as well as total suicides and homicides -rrb- fell . importantly , while there were 13 mass shootings in australia during the period of 1979 -- 96 , there have been none in the sixteen years since . in 1996 , then-prime minister john howard stated that the `` whole scheme is designed to reduce the number of guns in the community and make australia a safer place to live . '' the australian attorney general praised the cooperation and responsibility of australian firearms owners with the gun controls and buy-back , saying , `` they have been paid cash for their firearms - giving our nation a welcome christmas gift by removing unnecessary high-powered firearms from the community . it offers all of us the real chance of a safer festive season and new year . '' opinion : can we feel safe in a crowd anymore ? of course , the australian gun control law in 1997 enjoyed an extremely high level of public support and was not hampered by any domestic gun industry -lrb- since australia did not have any -rrb- . such would not be the case in the united states where pro-gun political views and nra power create a very different climate . in the wake of another tragic massacre of innocent lives , we should look carefully at the australian experience to see if the american public will ever rise up as one against gun violence . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of john j. donohue .	 a gunman went on a shooting rampage in a movie theater in colorado .   john j. donohue : our gun policy is made by the nra .   look to australia in formulating an effective gun control policy , he says .   donohue : the question is , will our country ever unify against gun violence . 	703

1686	the lack of universities in some parts of england is depriving pupils of the chance to gain a degree -- despite achieving good grades at school , according to a new study . these middle-class higher education ` cold spots ' can be found in the border areas between england and wales , along the cumbrian coast , in humberside and north yorkshire , from kent to the wash and in the south-west , the higher education funding council for england -lrb- hefce -rrb- said . in corringham and fobbing , thurrock , essex , for instance , it would be expected , based on academic performance at school , that 43.4 per cent of school leavers would go to university -- but the actual figure was just 25.6 per cent . scroll down for video . there are middle-class higher education ` cold spots ' in the border areas between england and wales , along the cumbrian coast , in humberside and north yorkshire , from kent to the wash and in the south-west . the interactive hefce map below shows the cold and hot spots in england for university participation : . the report painted a similar picture in dorchester east , dorset , where 48.1 per cent of school leavers would be expected to go on to higher education , but just 31.3 per cent actually did . the picture , however , is fairly complex . for example in leeds and birmingham , where there is a relatively high number of higher education institutions , the proportion of young people progressing to higher education is lower than expected in relation to their gcse attainment . with a few exception , much of lincolnshire has a low proportion of students entering higher education . red denotes low numbers , moving up through orange , yellow , turquoise and dark blue -lrb- the highest -rrb- . south wales also has a high number of regions where students are largely not progressing to university . likely due to free university places , scotland has a high proportion of students entering higher education . the report is the first time that school and higher education data together with employment and mobility data has been meshed to give a comprehensive and detailed picture of higher education participation and provision , employment and graduate mobility . professor madeleine atkins , hefce chief executive , said that the report , which includes an interactive map of the education cold spots , could be used to identify areas where new campuses could be built . she said : ` the data shows us that the issues associated with higher education cold spots can often be complex . ' coastal regions of the north-east also suffer from low number of those heading to university . she added : ` higher education providers , working collaboratively with their local enterprise partnerships , will be able to use this powerful new toolkit to establish a detailed picture of higher education in their localities , enabling them to identify any gaps in provision , participation and the supply of graduates . ` this provides a strong evidence base to explore potential solutions for delivering local economic recovery and growth . ` universities and colleges play a key role as economic and social anchors in their local and wider communities . working with local partners in this way to reach a joint understanding of the issues that affect them collectively , they can make an important contribution to the ongoing development of strategic economic plans , and also , of course , to decisions about where and when to invest different forms of funding . ' the lack of universities in some parts of england is depriving some pupils of the chance to gain a degree . earlier this year research showed that the number of students who are satisfied with their degree hit a record high , although thousands still said they are not happy with the overall quality of their course . it revealed the vast majority of undergraduates are content with the teaching and learning resources on their course , but less happy with the assessment and feedback they receive . undergraduates at bath university , keele university , st andrews university and st mary 's university college are among the happiest with their degree , according to the annual national student survey .	 there are large areas of england that lack university provision , a study said .   these ` cold spots ' mean many teens are missing out on university places .   areas lacking higher education opportunities include cumbria and humberside . 	738

'' when perry entered the race in august , he immediately did well in the polls . but a series of gaffes , particularly at debates against his rivals , sent his support plummeting . on thursday , his campaign website continued to say `` help rick perry win south carolina and get america back on track . '' perry 's official campaign facebook page was filled with posts , largely from disappointed voters .	 perry endorses gingrich , says he has heart of `` conservative reformer ''   the final debate before the south carolina primary takes place tonight on cnn .   the gingrich and santorum campaigns reached out for perry 's endorsement , source tells cnn .   the latest poll showed perry at 6 % among likely voters in the south carolina republican primary . 	704

8865	a pakistani former dancing girl left fighting for life by a ` horrific ' acid attack has committed suicide a decade after being heavily facially disfigured . fakhra younus , 33 , leapt to her death from a sixth floor building in rome 12 years after the acid attack which she said left her looking ` not human ' . at the time of her attack in may 2000 , her ex-husband bilal khar was the man accused of entering her mother 's house and pouring acid over younus 's face as she slept . life-changing : fakhra younus , pictured left before the horrific acid attack in may 2000 , was left heavily facially disfigured after having acid thrown in her face . the attack , which took place in front of younus 's then five-year-old son , left her unable to breathe and fighting for life . her nose was almost completely melted and she has since undergone 39 separate surgical procedures to repair her disfigured face over the past decade . the horrific attack also burned off her hair , fused her lips , blinded her in one eye , destroyed her left ear and melted her breasts . after being rushed to hospital she said , ` my face is a prison to me ' , while her distraught young son said at the time , ` this is not my mother ' . disfigured : younus , left , pictured with supporter tehmina durrani , has undergone 39 separate surgical operations to repair the damage done to her face . the mother-of-one moved to italy after the incident to live in rome and continue her treatment . but on march 17 she took her own life , after leaving a message saying she was committing suicide over the silence of law on the atrocities and the insensitivity of pakistani rulers . cleared : younus 's ex-husband bilal khar , the son of a wealthy pakistani governor , was cleared in 2003 of charges relating to the attack . bilal khar was arrested in 2002 and charged with attempted murder following the attack , only to be released on bail after five months . khar , an ex-parliamentarian and son of a wealthy pakistani governor , was eventually cleared of the attack , though many believe he could have used his family connections to escape conviction . after younus 's tragic suicide emerged earlier this month , khar continued to deny having any part in the attack - claiming in a television interview a different man with the same name had carried out the crime . khar claimed his ex-wife killed herself because she did n't have enough money , not because of her horrific injuries . more than 8,500 acid attacks , forced marriages and other forms of violence against women were reported in pakistan in 2011 , according to the aurat foundation , a women 's rights organization . the pakistani government introduced new laws last year criminalising acid attacks and stating that convicted attacks would serve at least 14 years in jail . tehmina durrani , the ex-wife of bilal khar 's father , had become an advocate for younus after the attack , and said the acid attack victim had pledged to bring her attacker to justice when she had recovered . mourning : fakhra younus 's body is carried through karachi airport in her native pakistan after her body was returned to the country from italy . grief : family members of fakhra younus can not hide their anguish at karachi airport as the acid attack victim 's body was returned to pakistan . durrani said : ` she said , ` when i come back , i will reopen the case , and i 'll fight myself , '' and she was a fighter . ' durrani said younus ' case should be a reminder that the pakistani government needs to do much more to prevent acid attacks and other forms of violence against women , and also help the victims .

2234	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- fbi k-9 dogs hit on items around the southern arizona home of a missing 6-year-old girl on monday , prompting authorities to take over the house , a police chief said . tucson police chief roberto villasenor said monday night that the `` specialized k-9s -lrb- were -rrb- flown in '' to help in the case of young isabel mercedes celis , who was reported missing on saturday morning . the dogs `` did alert on some things that caused us to go back '' to the house , said the chief . while they 've described her disappearance as suspicious , local authorities have not identified any suspects in isabel 's case nor have they indicated what they believe may have happened to her . they have launched an extensive search in a 3-mile radius of the girl 's home , where she lives with her parents and two older brothers , as well as contacted all registered sex offenders living nearby . villasenor said on monday morning that authorities had combed through the area `` at least three times now , '' with neighbor cynthia mort vouching that they 'd `` searched inside and outside every home in the neighborhood .

'' villasenor did not specify what the fbi k-9 dogs hit on , or the possible significance . he did say that , because of their reaction , authorities sought and obtained a search warrant to occupy the house . he said they asked for a warrant `` just to make sure everything is done correctly , '' not because the family at the center of the case is n't cooperating . hawke said the family left voluntarily . `` we have asked the family if they would be willing to leave so that we can avoid any potential evidence contamination , ... -lrb- and -rrb- they have agreed to do so , '' the police sergeant said . one street away from one of tucson 's busiest thoroughfares , the celis ' home is in a neighborhood of largely middle-class , single-family residences . a fence and wall surround the yard of the house . mort described isabel 's family as `` wonderful , caring people . '' `` they are always helping , you always see them together , '' said mort , who has lived next door to isabel 's grandparents for the past 25 years . `` they are very , very loving . i could n't imagine anyone in this family doing anything to anyone . '' she added that isabel 's disappearance has rocked the community , leaving `` everybody ... totally distraught .
