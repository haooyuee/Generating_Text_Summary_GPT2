# Automatic Text Summarization Study - COMP550

## Overview
This repository contains the research work on automatic text summarization within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our study evaluates three advanced deep learning models: GPT-2, T5, and GPT-3.5, using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. 

## Models
Each model's unique architectural design has been assessed using a comprehensive set of metrics, including:
- ROUGE scores
- BERT scores
- Manual evaluation

## Findings
The analysis revealed that different models have varied strengths in summarization tasks, highlighting how architectural differences influence performance outcomes. This study emphasizes the need for diverse evaluation methods to fully understand the capabilities of NLP models, thereby offering insights into future improvements for automatic text summarization.

## Team
- **Haoyue**: Led the GPT-2 modeling and initial draft writing.
- **Linrui**: Managed the T5 model assessment.
- **Yujun**: Conducted GPT-3.5 model evaluation, including output analysis and comparison.

All authors have contributed to revising and finalizing the research report collaboratively.
