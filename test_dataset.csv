' on monday this week the same magazine said that mrs merkel is actively plotting for an eu without britain in it and thinks david cameron and the british are the statler and waldorf of europe , it was claimed yesterday . the german chancellor apparently likens the prime minister to the grumpy muppets who constantly grumble from the sidelines .	 german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble ` determined ' to end euro crisis .   plan is to give eu greater powers over national budgets of individual states .   making the european commissioner for economic and currency affairs equally as powerful as the commissioner for competition .   forcing individual member states to hand over part of their budget sovereignty to brussels , allowing the currency affairs commissioner to exercise veto power over national budgets . this would give brussels to the right to send back budgets to countries if it did n't like the look of them .   creating ` more democracy ' by getting the european parliament involved in ` all important processes ' much sooner than at present . he also wants to change the voting structure - britain , for instance , would be excluded from voting on issues concerning the euro because it does n't use it . 	544

'' the desire to curate what he was seeing , coupled with a longtime ambition to create books , led him to give publishing a try . while le govic had preselected a number of established photographers to feature in this year 's inaugural anthology -lrb- he 's hoping it will become an annual publication -rrb- , he also gave instagram users the chance to put themselves up for consideration , using the hashtag #outofthephone to nominate their best works . he was astounded to receive over 20,000 submissions . what was he looking for in a successful entry ? technical skill was understandably important , but le govic says he also sought something less tangible . `` at the end , what is important is the story and the sensibility of the photographer ... it 's a mix between a good story , a good composition , '' he says . `` photography , for me , is a sort of fresh air , a way to look at things differently . so i 'm looking for that sort of feeling when i look at pictures .

'' the washington post was n't as gentle in its review , finding that the ironic lack of intimacy on `` britney jean '' makes the disc `` instantly forgettable . '' `` the result is n't remotely personal , does n't venture much beyond the usual britney themes -- fame is confusing , sex is fun , i am a totally normal person with the same worries as you , let 's dance -- and will do nothing to reassure anyone that the once familiar , pre-2007 britney is in there anywhere , '' the review says . the atlantic agrees , dismissing `` britney jean '' as spears ' `` most disappointing release yet , a snoozefest of shallow mid-tempos and limp club tracks that chase trends rather than invent them . and the glimpses into britney jean spears , the artist , are , frankly , neither interesting nor informative . '' the los angeles times warns that `` whatever unique skills spears once had -- what were they again , anyway ? -- ` britney jean ' suggests she better prepare herself for the reality that she 's losing them fast . ... there 's very little beneath the album 's many cliches to suggest insight , let alone the unfiltered honesty of autobiography . '' that said , if you 're a fan of post-2007 spears , which includes the smash album `` blackout , '' then `` britney jean '' might be your cup of dance-pop tea . rolling stone gave spears ' effort three-and-a-half stars , appraising `` britney jean '' as continuing `` the roll she 's been on in recent years . ... like her excellent late-summer electro-sleaze hit , ` work b *** h , ' ` britney jean ' adds up the high price of stardom . it 's a concept album about the loneliness of pop life -- with a high-profile broken engagement behind her , brit gets personal and drops her most bummed-out music ever . '' mtv , too , was able to see the heart underneath the driving beat . `` most of the tracks sound like a wild night out , '' the network said in an early review . but added `` it 's when you dig under all the reverb and edm beats that you hear that ` britney jean ' really is coming from her heart -- one beating at 500 miles an hour .

' more than half of british adults regularly use mouthwash , creating a market worth # 180 million a year . the study compared blood pressure levels in 19 healthy volunteers who started using corsodyl twice daily . their blood pressure rose by between 2 and 3.5 units -lrb- mmgh -rrb- . this effect ` appeared within one day ' of using the mouthwash , researchers wrote in the journal free radical biology and medicine . for each two-point rise in blood pressure , the risk of dying from heart disease rises by seven per cent , according to separate research . such a rise also increases the risk of dying from stroke by ten per cent . heart disease and stroke are the biggest killer in britain . prof ahluwalia , from queen mary university of london , said : ` we are not telling people to stop using antiseptic mouthwashes if they have a gum or tooth infection -- but we would ask why anyone else would want to . ' dangerous rinse : the study by queen mary university in london found that blood pressure in daily corsodyl users rose by between 2 and 3.5 units . corsodyl contains 0.2 per cent by volume of the antiseptic chlorhexidine . other antiseptic mouthwashes made by boots and superdrug contain the chemical in the same concentration . it kills microbes needed to help create nitrite , essential for blood vessels to dilate properly . but the mouthwash caused nitrite production in the mouth to fall by over 90 per cent , and blood nitrite to fall by 25 per cent . not all mouthwashes contain chlorhexidine : listerine , for example , does not . however , prof ahluwalia said : ` other mouthwashes could still disrupt the healthy bacteria . ' dentist richard guyver said he would be ` very cautious about drawing conclusions ' from such a small study . corsodyl makers glaxosmithkline said their product was for short-term use to stop plaque and prevent gum disease and it also makes another product , corsodyl daily , which contains 0.06 per cent chlorhexidine for everyday use . the spokesman said their own research had ` not highlighted any concerns regarding the use of corsodyl 0.2 per cent mouthwash as directed and increases in blood pressure ' .	 mouthwash brand corsodyl has been found to increase blood pressure .   study found blood pressure rose between 2 and 3.5 units for daily users . 	514

8702	las vegas residents fear voodoo rituals are to blame for piles of headless cockerels and pigeons that are being found on the city 's streets . piles of birds , intact save for their heads , have been left in several locations in the past few weeks , but every time they are cleared away , more bodies appear . west african priest duane reece has confirmed that the sightings could be linked to magic rituals , saying someone could be trying to use voodoo to appease a spirit . scroll down for video . ritual : the appearance of headless roosters in the back alleys of las vegas has been blamed on voodoo rituals . the birds are mostly roosters and pigeons , and they appear in perfect condition except that their heads have been neatly lopped off . street cleaner ryan roskins started to see the headless chickens a few weeks back , and told klas-tv he has continued to see carcasses as he makes his rounds . ` the first time i saw it , it was a large rooster . everything else is there , feet , feathers . it 's just decapitated , ' he said . ' i actually think it must be voodoo . ' reece , a priest for the african ifa religion which has similarities to voodoo , said the placing of the birds would suggest it is part of a ritual . ` they might be wiping themselves with . the bird , letting the blood and then having to discard the body , ' reece said . he added that those who follow religions like ifa often sacrifice birds and goats for protection or cleansing rituals . the carcasses then have to be left in a place the ` deity is calling out for ' he added . voodoo : duane reece , a priest of the african ifa religion , says the birds may be part of a cleansing ritual . distrubing : the headless pigeons and other birds has upset store owners , who say they are a health risk . with voodoo , most birds or animals used for sacrifice are usually eaten afterwards in communal meals , and their blood is splashed over altars . but for business owners in vegas , having to constantly call animal control to have the dead birds removed has become a sickening chore . the stench of rotting chicken lingers in the alleys behind their businesses , and the store owners are concerned about possible health risks .	 piles of dead birds have been spotted in alleys across the city .   headless chickens may be cleansing ritual , african ifa priest says . 	429
3233	alan miliburn , the government 's social mobility adviser , said the middle classes , as well as those on low incomes , struggle to make it to the top . middle class children are being held back by ` entrenched elitism ' which means the rich and privately-educated are a third more likely to get top jobs , a government adviser warned today . alan milburn , the social mobility tsar , said it was not just children from poorer families who struggled to ` move up and get on ' . in the latest high-profile attack on the privileged elite who run britain , he said it was time to ` break open the closed shop ' at the top of society . david cameron has been stung by criticism of the wealthy background of many in the cabinet . former tory prime minister sir john major took a swipe last month , warning the conservatives can not win if they fail to understand the ` silent have-nots ' who suffer in ` net curtain poverty ' . new research from the social mobility and child poverty commission found that privately-educated graduates are one-third more likely to get top jobs than state school-educated graduates . in a speech today mr miliburn said : ` a society where opportunities are frozen rather than fluid hurts more than those at the very bottom end . ` it hurts the people president clinton once famously called the `` forgotten middle class '' . ` they , and not just low income families , are the victims of entrenched elitism in our country . ' the former labour cabinet minister told social mobility experts that the problem did not affect just people from working class backgrounds , but was also a block on the aspirations of middle class families . part of this gap was explained by the fact that top employers continue to recruit from a narrow range of highly selective universities , where those who went to independent schools tend to be over-represented , said the commission . research shows the increased probability of working in a top job if privately educate , compared with attending a state school . but it also found that even where two similarly qualified graduates have attended the same university and got the same degree , a privately-schooled graduate is still 8 per cent more likely to get a top job than a state-schooled one . mr milburn added : ` social mobility relies on people across the income spectrum being able to move up and get on . ` we have a twin problem in our country : middle class aspirations and working class opportunities to advance are both being thwarted . ' commission analysis suggested that some of the career advantage for privately-educated graduates comes from having social connections that state-educated graduates are less likely to enjoy . but it found that most of the gap is unexplained . 10.5 % of all graduates work in a top professional job , while privately educated graduates are 6 percentage points more likely than state school graduates to work in these jobs . mr milburn said the expansion of the middle classes would help more people to break through into the top of society . he said : ` a twin solution is needed : we need to break open the closed shop at the top of british society and expand the middle . ` it should be our country 's ambition to create a bigger middle class with more avenues for advancement . a growing middle-class is the foundation for a more mobile country . ' mr milburn outlined a five-point policy agenda , involving expanding early years education ; paying the best teachers more for working in disadvantaged areas ; opening up universities to a wider pool of talent and making vocational education a national priority ; increasing the minimum wage ; and expanding entry to the professions by getting firms to recruit from a wider range of universities and ending unpaid internships .	 graduates who went to private schools still dominate modern britain .   social mobility and child poverty commission reveals scale of challenge .   alan milburn warns middle class children suffer as well as the poor .   ex-labour minister says they are victims of ` entrenched elitism ' 	682

' i give it everything - it 's not just pushing a button . you 've got to have faith in what you do - you ca n't fake faith . ' the projects are meticulously planned before the laser comes out . he said : ' i sketch a composition first , working out an overall goal . ` then i draw each layer in vector-based software . each layer is cut individually with a cnc laser . standley 's projects are inspired by gothic , islamic , and greek art motifs . this one looks like a window to the sea made of delicate loops of paper . standley began working with lasers on his own paintings before trying the technique on card and then paper . up to 80 hours is spent on the cutting of the paper alone . ` the work is then cleaned of chads -lsb- leftover bits of paper -rsb- , assembled and bound like a flip book . ` the . final stage of my process includes building a mount and frame that . holds the work , allowing for a degree of movement that is inherent with . paper . ' professor standley took inspiration by . gothic , islamic , and greek art motifs , first copying their geometry before ` riffing ' his own ideas . different angles reveal more detail in each piece thanks to the way they are stacked . the plan for each design is sketched out by hand then drawn in vector-based software . the 3d pieces are often symmetrical to mimic ancient art motifs . the creations mimic the symmetry of his influences and reveal colours and shapes when explored from different angles . he said : ` i 've been fortunate in the . work 's reception . someone described my work as `` otherworldly '' . that rang . positively with me . ` truly . this work could not be done without the use of technology , although . whatever the reason , i 'm lucky enough to have the patience to do what i . do .

' the taliban commander - identified only as mawlvi in the interview - was speaking to michael semple , a former un envoy to kabul who had maintained strong contacts with the radical group . despite the insurgents pumping out triumphalist rhetoric about their successes against coalition forces , mawlvi said the only way forward for the group is to come to a political agreement with opponents . shocking : a video clip of a taliban soldier gunning down a woman sparked international outrage this week . fury : afghan women hold banners and placards during a protest against the execution of the unnamed afghan woman by taliban militants . he said : ` the taliban capturing kabul is a very distant prospect . ` any taliban leader expecting to be able to capture kabul is making a grave mistake . ` nevertheless , the leadership also knows that it can not afford to acknowledge this weakness . ` to do so would undermine the morale of taliban personnel . the leadership knows the truth -- that they can not prevail over the power they confront . ` it would take some kind of divine intervention for the taliban to win this war . ' the taliban , he said , had shelved its vision of re-establishing the islamic emirate it set up when in power from 1996 to 2001 . this regime banned women from education , carried out thousands of executions as rough justice and outlawed eating lobster , even though afghanistan has no coastline . cost of war : a total of 422 uk troops have been killed since the conflict began in 2001 . ` any side involved in a conflict like . this has decided to fight for power , ' he said . ` if they fall short of . national power , they have to settle for functioning as an organised . party within the country . ' mr . semple said speaking unofficially allowed mawlvi to stray from the . taliban 's ` party line ' and reflect the views of its pragmatic wing . this , he said , was a sign that the group wanted to re-open talks with the u.s. however , only a few days ago video footage was released depicting the unwavering brutality of the taliban , executing a woman for adultery . she was machinegunned in cold blood because two commanders could not decide who should ` own ' her . mawlvi 's suggestion that the taliban could be open to dialogue was welcomed by western politicians with former foreign secretary david miliband calling the commander 's comments a ` landmark ' moment . ` the candour and clarity of the remarks about al-qaeda , nato and the afghan government show we are dealing with a sophisticated and long-term presence , ' he said . a total of 422 uk troops have been killed since the war began in 2001 .	 the senior commander said it would take ` divine intervention ' for the hardline group to recapture kabul . 	731

1103	homosexuality is passed down through the generations from mother to son and from father to daughter , a new study claims . from an evolutionary standpoint , homosexuality is a trait that would not be expected to develop and persist in the face of darwinian natural selection . it is nevertheless common for men and women in most cultures and previous studies have shown that homosexuality runs in families , leading most researchers to presume a genetic underpinning of sexual preference . puzzle : scientists had long puzzled over why homosexuality appears to run in families when as a genetic trait it would not be expected to develop and persist in the face of darwinian natural selection . however , no major gene for homosexuality has been found despite numerous studies searching for a genetic connection . now in a study published yesterday in the quarterly review of biology , researchers from the u.s. national institute of mathematical and biological synthesis suggest homosexuality has an epigenetic link , not a genetic one . epigenetics explains how gene expression is regulated by temporary switches , called epi-marks . these constitute an extra layer of information attached to our genes ' backbones that determine their effect on our development . while genes hold the instructions , epi-marks direct how those instructions are carried out -- when , where and how much a gene is expressed during development . gay marriage : a study suggests homosexuality has an epigenetic link , not a genetic one , allowing it to confound the usual rules of evolution . epi-marks are usually produced anew each generation , but recent evidence demonstrates that they sometimes carryover between generations and thus can contribute to similarity among relatives , resembling the effect of shared genes . william rice , an an evolutionary biologist at the university of california santa barbara and lead author of the study , says epi-marks can determine the development of homosexuality in the offspring of heterosexual parents . ` there is compelling evidence that epi-marks contribute to both the similarity and dissimilarity of family members , and can therefore feasibly contribute to the observed familial inheritance of homosexuality and its low concordance between -lsb- identical -rsb- twins , ' he told u.s. news . dr rice and his team integrated evolutionary theory with recent advances in the molecular regulation of gene expression and androgen-dependent sexual development to produce a biological and mathematical model that delineates the role of epigenetics in homosexuality . sex-specific epi-marks produced in early foetal development protect each sex from the substantial natural variation in testosterone that occurs during later foetal development , the researchers say . sex-specific epi-marks stop girl foetuses from being masculinised when they experience atypically high testosterone , and vice versa for boy foetuses . different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinised or feminised -- some affect the genitals , others sexual identity , and yet others affect sexual partner preference . however , when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons , they may cause reversed effects , such as the feminisation of some traits in sons , such as sexual preference , and similarly a partial masculinisation of daughters . the study solves the evolutionary riddle of homosexuality , finding that ` sexually antagonistic ' epi-marks , which normally protect parents from natural variation in sex hormone levels during foetal development , sometimes carry over across generations and cause homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring . the mathematical modeling demonstrates that genes coding for these epi-marks can easily spread in the population because they always increase the fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure and reduce fitness in offspring . ` transmission of sexually antagonistic epi-marks between generations is the most plausible evolutionary mechanism of the phenomenon of human homosexuality , ' said study co-author sergey gavrilets , a professor at the university of tennessee-knoxville .	 new study answers puzzle of why homosexuality seems to run in families .   it would not be expected to persist given darwinian natural selection .   researchers show it is an epigenetic rather than a genetic trait . 	659

4699	-lrb- cnn -rrb- looking for a spa break ? in the past , the world 's chill-seekers might have ventured to thailand or india to get their massage fix . in the future , they 're more apt to be africa-bound . a new report in the global spa and wellness monitor puts sub-saharan africa as the world 's fastest growing region for wellness tourism . the number of spas has tripled since 2007 , and spa revenue has leaped 184 % . the number of those lured to the continent for a little r&r has also soared . 2013 saw 4.2 million wellness tourists -- a 90 % increase from 2012 . as a testament to this growth , this year 's annual global spa and wellness summit took place in morocco -- the first time the event was held on african soil . `` africa is seen as the final frontier . it 's virgin territory , '' says magatte wade , the senegal-born founder and ceo of beauty brand tiossan , and a keynote speaker at the summit . she attributes the continent 's spike in spas not only to the increase of international travelers , but to the growth of the consumer class within africa . `` the middle class is growing , there are more african billionaires right now , and then you have people like me , who 've had the opportunity to live all over the world and have money to spend , and want to go back home and have the same top-of-the-line service you have in new york or tokyo , '' she says . the wellness trend has also started to leak into africa 's safari industry , according to henry hallward , founder of both the good safari guide and the safari awards , and former chairman of the african tourism and travel association . hallward estimates there are 9,000 safari lodge operators today , up from approximately 400 in 1995 . pampering , he admits , has also become a stronger focus . `` almost every safari lodge that i 'm aware of has added into its suite of services either massage , or else an entire spa branded by product suppliers , '' he says . a geographical shift . even countries that were once eschewed due to political concerns are set to emerge as wellness hotspots . hallward says he 's seen growth in markets such as ethiopia and even the sudan , `` now that the politics has calmed down . '' he is also noticing a shift in the type of safaris on offer . the old formula of trekking the `` big five '' in the masai mara from the comfort of a jeep is outdated . instead , safaris are becoming more active , and different countries are starting to specialize in niche versions . `` botswana has become the center for safaris on horseback , while malawi and zambia are emerging for the underwater wildlife experience , '' he says . wade too is also noticing growth in regions that were once considered off-limits . `` angola is getting up there , and rwanda is starting to pay attention . it 's still in its infancy there , but it will grow fast , '' she says . a taste of the continent . wade says there is an incredible opportunity for new properties to embrace the numerous healing traditions and natural ingredients indigenous in the continent . her product line , which boasts senegalese black seed oil , is one of the few to do so , but wade is hoping it 's a trend that will spread . `` there are 54 countries in africa , and each of these has dozens upon dozens of different healing rituals . there is a richness and diversity that we need to tap into , '' she says . so far only a handful of brands have taken a similar track -- such as the south african spa brand healing earth , which incorporates local ingredients like kalahari melon or mongongo nut . wade worries about the implications if more do n't follow suit : . `` if we 're not careful , the wellness industry will come and put a blanket over what we already have . they 'll bring the asian - and european-inspired traditions they already know , and what we 've had for thousands of years will be lost , '' she warns .	 africa has a multitude of healing traditions and ingredients .   the spa industry in africa is soaring . it 's the fastest growing market for wellness tourism .   there is opportunity for beauty brands and resorts to showcase these traditions to the world . 	756

4733	going to the academy awards has been dangerous for jennifer lawrence . for two years , the actress could n't seem to stay upright at the event , tripping once in 2013 when walking to the stage to accept her oscar for `` silver linings playbook , '' and then falling again when arriving for the ceremony this march . so is lawrence really that accident-prone , or are her repeat tumbles some sort of scheme to become more relatable , and thus more likable ? well if it is a plot , lawrence tells marie claire in its june issue , she 'd be smarter about executing it . at the 2014 oscars , lawrence says she was `` trying to do the right thing '' as she got out of her limo . she was `` waving to fans , trying to be nice , and there 's a traffic cone , '' she recalls . `` the second i hit it , i was laughing , but on the inside i was like , ` you 're f **** d. they 're totally going to think this is an act ... ' but trust me if i was going to plan it , i would have done it at the golden globes or the sags . i would have never done it at two oscars in a row . i watch ` homeland ' -- i 'm craftier than that ! '' that kind of answer is exactly the reason fans adore lawrence ; she 's uber-talented but also down-to-earth enough to freak out on a reporter who spoiled the last season of `` homeland . '' yet the kentucky-bred star insists that becoming famous has worn off some of her average jane charm , telling marie claire that these days , she 's `` a lot more closed off and frankly probably rude . '' `` i mean , i 'm from kentucky . i used to be very personable and make eye contact and smile at people , and now all i do is look down , '' the 23-year-old says . `` when i 'm at dinner and one person after another keeps interrupting to take pictures , it 's like , ' i ca n't live like this . ' '' but one thing lawrence has learned to live with is a long-distance relationship . both the actress and her boyfriend , `` x-men : days of future past '' co-star nicholas hoult , are busy building their careers , and they 've agreed it 's ok to `` mutually ignore each other '' for a bit when necessary . `` neither of us gets mad when the other does n't text back or call . life 's super-busy , '' the actress says . `` obviously you know what they 're doing , and you trust them . we 're so young that it would almost be like if we lived in the same city , what would happen ? we 'd be living together . at least this way he 's in the same boat as i am : we can go out and have our own lives and know that we have each other . '' it 's not an overstatement that lawrence keeps a busy schedule ; for the next two years she 's committed to wrapping up `` the hunger games '' franchise with `` mockingjay '' parts 1 and 2 , plus filming another `` x-men '' movie , `` x-men : apocalypse , '' all of which comes on the heels of the highly touted david o. russell movie `` american hustle . '' the latter earned lawrence another raft of praise and an oscar nomination for best supporting actress , a nod that some prognosticators thought she might cinch . in the end , the gold went to `` 12 years a slave '' actress lupita nyong ` o , and lawrence says she could n't have been more thrilled . `` i was very happy i voted for lupita , '' lawrence said . `` it 's beautiful when you watch something good happen to somebody when it 's well deserved .

2204	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- supreme court justice sonia sotomayor was thrust into the national spotlight on two hot-button issues this week . it had nothing to do with the cases involved -- same-sex marriage in utah and a requirement for contraceptive coverage under obamacare . the two emergency appeals on new year 's eve came her way because the cases originated in western areas of the country -- colorado and utah -- that fall under her jurisdiction for reviewing time-sensitive federal motions . sotomayor sought more information on an appeal from utah to uphold its voter-approved ban on same-sex unions in the state . but she made headlines on the politically charged case around the affordable care act just as new rules were about to take effect . sotomayor issued an order that , for the moment , stayed a requirement under the sweeping health law for certain religiously affiliated groups to ensure that employees receive coverage for contraception at no cost . the denver-based organization that cares for elderly poor , the little sisters of the poor , objects to complying with rules under the law that would guarantee it an exemption but , in theory , still require a third party to provide contraception insurance . ultimately , it believes authorizing a form that passes the ball to another entity still means contraception coverage for its employees and that , to the nuns , is objectionable on moral grounds . the catholic church opposes artificial contraception . while sotomayor 's emergency injunction or any follow up to extend it or seek the opinion of her fellow justices for additional review may seem like a blow to the politically charged health care law , it is n't . nor does it convey any meaning about where sotomayor , a liberal jurist , may stand on the larger issues raised in the appeal overall . `` she just placed a single case on hold . she did not overturn obamacare , '' cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin said . her decision late on tuesday simply put the brakes on compliance for the little sisters of the poor and enabled the obama administration to file its arguments . the justice department said on friday the appeal lacked merit . the charity , it said , is eligible for an exemption and moreover , the entity that administers its insurance plans , the non-profit christian brothers services , is also exempt under certain conditions in the obamacare rules applying to religious institutions . toobin said sotomayor acted `` based on her view of the law '' in holding up the rule in this case . sotomayor voted to uphold the affordable care act in 2012 in a blockbuster supreme court ruling that gave obama an enormous political victory . obamacare seeks to extend health coverage to millions of americans without it and is the president 's signature domestic achievement . it is relentlessly under attack from conservatives who have made numerous attempts to repeal or otherwise sink it , and is the focus of numerous legal challenges .	 sotomayor upheld obamacare last year , now she 's in the spotlight again in another appeal .   she issued stay to give denver nuns reprieve on providing birth control to workers .   `` she just placed a single case on hold . she did not overturn obamacare , '' analyst says .   sotomayor got the case because the nuns live in denver , a town in her `` region '' 	516

8506	president obama has sent a special unit of cia officers to the uk to investigate british muslim extremists amid growing fears in washington that we are becoming a ` breeding ground ' for terrorism . in a pointed snub to mi5 , the agents arrived on a ` lone wolf ' mission to interrogate senior security experts about the radicalisation of uk muslims . the mission has been revealed as our security services have been forced to admit they are struggling to keep track of the estimated 500 britons who have travelled to the middle east to fight alongside the islamic isis forces in syria and iraq . snub : barack obama has sent a special unit of cia officers to the uk to investigate british muslim extremists . it is unusual for the cia to send a team to the uk : the agency usually relies on information passed to it by mi5 or mi6 or by its agents stationed at the american embassy in london . sources have told the mail on sunday that the agents were keen to establish the ` stability ' of the relationship between the sunni and shia branches of muslims in the uk . the fighters going out to join isis have been british-based sunnis , causing deepening tensions within the community . professor anthony glees , of the centre for security and intelligence studies at buckingham university , said the mission , which took place earlier this year , showed the level of concern in washington over the issue , which he claimed was rooted in the uk 's ` lax ' immigration policies . ` the us is worried about the british situation . they fear there might be a knock-on effect for them , ' prof glees said . ` the throat-cutting between sunnis and shias in iraq and syria has not yet spread to the uk , but it is a real threat . it is conceivable you could see shia `` hit squads '' in britain targeting sunnis preparing to go out to the conflict zones to fight .

' last night a source at the cia insisted british intelligence had been informed of ` all outside contacts ' the agents made in the uk . however , the sources also admitted that the move revealed a growing lack of trust in washington over mi5 and mi6 's ability to provide a reliable assessment of the security threat presented by young muslims under the sway of imams who are radicalised and then recruited to fight in religious wars around the globe . the obama administration has become increasingly anxious that young american muslims could follow the same pattern . there are strong links between british and american radicals and the sources say the cia feels british efforts to identify and unmask them have been inadequate . a cia and a home office spokesman declined to comment .	 sources said u.s. agents want to assess stability of muslim relations in uk .   normally obama relies on intelligence passed directly from the british .   but fears have ramped up after recent radicalisation of young britons . 	583

2379	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- he had a distinguished voice like actor robert stack and the looks of a hollywood actor . but it was his investigative and storytelling skills that set longtime cnn correspondent and bureau chief robert vito apart from the rest . vito died wednesday night at his son 's home in singapore after a long battle with pancreatic cancer . vito was a correspondent for cnn for 17 years . in that time , he served as the first cnn detroit bureau chief and later was the network 's rome bureau chief but he was better known for the stories he broke and covered . he won two cable ace awards and several national and local emmys . with cnn , he covered some of the biggest stories of the '80s and '90s , including the branch-davidian standoff in waco , texas ; the oklahoma city bombing ; and the o.j. simpson murder trial . few knew it , but he was educated to be a teacher . he taught in a school in illinois , but he wanted something different . he modeled in print ads and eventually landed a job as a radio reporter in wisconsin . it was an act of fate and weather that brought vito into the forefront of television news . in 1968 , he had just been hired at waeo-tv -lrb- now wjfw -rrb- in rhinelander , wisconsin , as a general assignment reporter . but high winds knocked down the station 's transmission tower . it knocked the station off the air , and vito out of a job . he took what little he had on a `` demo reel , '' some radio reports from a previous job , and photos from his days as a model , to milwaukee , where wisn-tv hired him . vito 's reports there led to construction of highway median barriers on milwaukee county freeways , and a career in tv investigative journalism was launched . in 1973 , he went to work for detroit 's wwj-tv -lrb- which later became wdiv -rrb- . in july 1975 , vito interviewed former teamsters boss jimmy hoffa . it was hoffa 's last media interview , broadcast two weeks before his disappearance . in 1982 , vito became the first detroit bureau chief for cnn , just two years after the fledgling cable network 's launch . the auto industry was a major part of his beat , and his reporting on industrial pollution affecting fish and possibly giving them cancer prompted a congressional hearing , where he testified and his reports were shown . in 1988 he became cnn 's rome bureau chief , followed by a move to cnn 's los angeles bureau the next year . from l.a. , he covered some of the top stories of the decade -- the rodney king beating and the riots that followed , the branch-davidian standoff , the terrorist bombing in oklahoma city , the o.j. simpson criminal trial and the mcmartin preschool case . from there he went on to cnn 's miami bureau , where he covered the trial of attorney f. lee bailey , the shooting down of civilian aircraft off the coast of cuba , and the slaying of fashion designer gianni versace . vito left cnn in 1999 and worked as a jury consultant for a tampa , florida , legal consulting firm . he later worked on documentaries before leaving the business to take care of his wife , nancy , who succumbed to cancer a year ago . last january , independent news service announced the broadcast industry recognition given to vito for over 45 years of dedication to investigative journalism . he 's survived by his son john , john 's wife , thanita , and his grandson , anthony . people we lost in 2013 .	 vito was cnn 's first detroit bureau chief , taking the job in 1982 .   he was with cnn for 17 years , also working in rome , los angeles , miami .   vito died wednesday night after a long battle with pancreatic cancer . 	652

' she added : ` people here should be warned that if we allowed euthanasia they might have a mobile unit at their door at some time . ' the units , which are backed by the dutch government , must conform to the 2002 law that made holland the first country in the world to allow euthanasia since nazi germany . value of life : archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said this week that it would be a ` disaster ' if assisted suicide was legalised in britain . this law stipulates that a person can only quality for euthanasia if their suffering is lasting and unbearable . the units were first revealed by health minister edith schippers in the dutch parliament late last year . she said that units ` for patients who meet the criteria for euthanasia but whose doctors are unwilling to carry it out ' was worthy of consideration . in holland , euthanasia is carried out by administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma , followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death . the dutch government insists ` the greatest care ' is taken to offer euthanasia only to patients ` who are suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement ' . the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , said in a general synod debate this week that it would be a ` disaster ' if assisted suicide was legalised in britain . ` to change the law on this subject is , i believe , to change something vital in our sense of the value of life itself , ' he said .	 teams will end the lives of additional 1,000 a year .   2,700 dutch people a year choose assisted suicide . 	608

4433	the food and drug administration on thursday took a step toward essentially a total ban on artificial trans fats in america 's food supply . this is not a trivial change . not that long ago , trans fats were a part of all kinds of processed foods . partially hydrogenated oils , as they are otherwise known , tend to improve both the shelf life and flavor of many foods . trans fats have been around for more than a hundred years . they 're used in a wide range of foods , from frozen pizza to microwave popcorn to packaged cookies . but trans fats are amazingly bad for you . by the 1990s , evidence was building that trans fats carried a significant risk for increasing coronary heart disease . specifically , they were found not only to increase your level of low-density lipoprotein -lrb- ldl , or bad cholesterol -rrb- but to decrease your level of high-density lipoprotein -lrb- hdl , or good cholesterol -rrb- . because of this , the negative effects of trans fats are about double those of saturated fat -lrb- which is n't that good for you , either -rrb- . it gets worse . trans fats also increase your level of lipoprotein -lrb- a -rrb- and triglycerides , both of which are thought to be associated with cardiovascular disease . these laboratory findings bear out in all kinds of epidemiologic studies showing that a diet containing higher levels of trans fats carried greater health risk than a diet similarly high in saturated fat . there has been a longstanding argument that we should stop using trans fats . the american heart association recommends that people 's diets contain 2 grams or less of trans fats a day . that amount is what you might normally get in dairy products and meat . but if you eat processed foods , you 'll end up consuming more trans fats . in 2006 , the fda started mandating that food labels list the amount of trans fats in foods in order to make consumers aware of their hazard . some companies have made an effort to stay away from trans fats . mcdonalds stopped using them 7 years ago . burger king has a minimal amount in its foods , and that 's from small amounts that are present naturally in meat and cheese . new york banned trans fats in restaurants in 2007 . it was a controversial decision at the time , but consumption of trans fats in the city has dropped dramatically because of the ban . the centers for disease control and prevention says that removing trans fats from the u.s. food supply could prevent about 20,000 heart attacks a year and 7,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease . finally , the fda issued a federal register notice announcing that trans fats are not `` generally recognized as safe . '' such a notice allows a period of time for people and businesses to comment and offer opinions and evidence if they believe that trans fats should not be banned . of course , there are costs to such a move . the fda estimates that it will cost about $ 8 billion initially to remove trans fats from the food supply . it believes the 20-year costs to be between $ 12 billion and $ 14 billion . i think it 's likely that processed food producers will comply . there 's almost no good evidence -- or argument -- to support the continued use of trans fats . in fact , it 's been reported that some manufacturers have voluntarily lowered the use of trans fats by almost 75 % in the past eight years . given these moves , it 's not hard to imagine them going the rest of the distance . there is some irony in this , of course . trans fats first became more common in our diet because they were believed to be safer than animal fats -lrb- think margarine instead of butter -rrb- . turns out the opposite is true . the fda 's actions are putting us on the road to correcting that mistake , hopefully sooner rather than later .	 the fda took a first step toward eliminating artificial trans fats in food supply .   aaron carroll : fda made the right move , since trans fats are very bad for people .   he says evidence shows trans fats increase bad cholesterol and heart disease .   carroll : it 's likely food suppliers will comply despite the costs of removing trans fats . 	710

' the drug , tenofovir , which is sold as viread , reduces a person 's risk of contracting hiv -lrb- pictured -rrb- by up to 50 per cent . scientists are also working on an hiv vaccine but the u.s. government recently stopped trials of the experimental vaccine after an independent review found it did not prevent hiv infection or reduce the amount of hiv in the blood . the research , started in 2009 , it is just the latest in a series of failed attempts to develop a vaccine for the virus . in the u.s. intravenous drug users account for about one in 13 new hiv infections but in the countries of eastern europe and central asia , they make up 80 per cent of those newly infected . according to the national aids trust 96,000 people in the uk are currently living with hiv . of these people , 22,600 are thought to be unaware of their infection . in 2011 , only one per cent of people with hiv in the uk died . the biggest group of hiv positive people in the uk are men who have sex with men - they account for about 40,000 of the hiv infected population .	 u.s. health experts say tenofovir should be approved for use by drug users .   is already approved for use by high-risk gay men and heterosexual couples .   it reduces hiv infection risk by up to 50 per cent . 	603
4359	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a militant islamist group associated with al qaeda has for the first time threatened to attack israel , far from its normal base of operations in somalia . al-shabab , which is fighting to control the east african country , accused israel of `` starting to destroy '' the al aqsa mosque , where standoffs have taken place recently between israeli police and palestinians . the mosque is part of the complex that jews call the temple mount and muslims call haram al-sharif . `` the jews started to destroy parts of the holy mosque of al aqsa and they routinely kill our palestinian brothers , so we are committed to defend our palestinian brothers , '' said mukhtar robow abu mansur , a prominent al-shabab commander . his threat was part of a series of fiery sermons delivered after friday prayers in baidoa in southwest somalia . al-shabab controls the region , which is part of a country that has been without an effective national government for nearly 20 years . other leaders of the group also threatened israel , the first time the group is known to have done so . `` we will transfer and expand our fighting in the middle east so we can defend al aqsa mosque from the israelis , '' al-shabab commander abdifatah aweys abu hamza said in mogadishu , the somali capital . he is apparently the leader of a new al-shabab armed group calling themselves `` mujahedin al aqsa , '' or `` al aqsa holy warriors , '' which they said is assigned to attack israel . it is not clear whether al-shabab has the capacity to carry out its threats against israel . but rashid abdi of the international crisis group , speaking last week before al-shabab issued its threats against israel , warned that the group should be taken seriously . `` we should not underestimate the capacity of al-shabab , '' he said . `` this is a deadly organization , a formidable foe . '' abdi said the group had been mutating from a nationalist group into a terrorist organization more like al qaeda , which was behind the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . `` if you look at the rhetoric and language and if you look at the web sites , if you hear their preachers or their scholars speak , it is completely indistinguishable from al qaeda leaders , '' abdi said . the group has also become more vicious in somalia , a local human rights expert said . `` the most gruesome and gross violations of human rights are committed by al-shabab , '' activist hassan shire sheikh said . `` they have also instilled fear . they just shoot , they kill , they maim and they lash . '' the group also threatened african neighbors on friday , including ethiopia , djibouti , kenya , eritrea , ghana , sudan and uganda . they have in the past threatened african nations that provide peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country . the u.s. state department country reports on terrorism from april lists al-shabab as a terrorist organization and blames it for shootings and suicide bombings inside somalia . it does not list the group as having carried out violence outside somalia , but says some members of the group have trained and fought alongside al qaeda in afghanistan . somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator mohamed siad barre and sparked brutal clan infighting . the transitional government has struggled to establish authority , challenged by islamist groups like al-shabab that have seized control of mogadishu and much of the south . cnn 's david mckenzie in nairobi , kenya , contributed to this report .	 al-shabab accuses israel of `` starting to destroy '' the al aqsa mosque .   `` we are committed to defend our palestinian brothers , '' al-shabab commander says .   it is not clear whether al-shabab has the capacity to carry out its threats against israel .   somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew its dictator . 	640

4290	berlin -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- four more deaths have been confirmed by german health officials friday bringing the total number of european deaths from an e. coli outbreak to 31 . all but one were in germany . according to german health authorities the bacteria has been traced to sprouts found in a north rhine-westphalia household in western germany . this is the first time the actual bacteria has been found in produce . the number of people infected with e. coli now stands at 2,988 , of whom 759 have the severe form of the intestinal illness . though the rate of infection is slowing , officials at the robert koch institute said the number of infections will continue to rise . a spokesman for the german ministry of consumer affairs said sprouts were tested in the home when two members of the family became infected after eating the sprouts . the vegetables in question seem to originate from a farm in northern germany that has already been linked to the outbreak , ministry spokesman stephan melessa . investigators determined bean sprouts were the cause of the outbreak after 17 people became ill after eating at the same restaurant , reinhard burger , president of the robert koch institute , told reporters . authorities questioned people about what they ate and asked the cooks where the ingredients came from , burger said . the common denominator , he said , was only those who ate food containing the sprouts became ill . farmers in spain , france , holland and belgium have been seeking compensation for their losses . the european commission has proposed that the european union pay about $ 300 million , but spain alone claims about $ 600 million in losses . in spain , the fresh produce exporter frunet filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit by a spanish company against the hamburg state government over its earlier allegations that spanish products were to blame for the e.coli outbreak . the complaint , filed thursday in hamburg , demands the immediate release of all laboratory tests and other documentation that hamburg officials used when they blamed -- wrongly it turns out -- frunet 's organic cucumbers as a source of the outbreak , frunet 's owner , antonio lavao , told cnn by phone on friday . frunet , based in spain 's southern malaga province , expects to file another lawsuit against the hamburg state government seeking 1 million euros -lrb- $ 144 million -rrb- in losses from fresh produce it had to destroy , lavao said . `` my company was named specifically '' by german authorities , lavao said . his exports remain blocked because even as german and european commission officials have cleared spanish cucumbers generally of any link to the outbreak , there remains suspicion among his clients since his firm was identified , wrongly , as a source of the bacteria , he said . `` we do n't want to be collateral damage . we want a specific rectification , '' lavao said . the lawsuit is the first of its kind by a spanish company against german authorities , said jose maria pozancos , managing director of spain 's fresh produce export federation fepex . frunet grows relatively few cucumbers ; its speciality is premium tomatoes for export . lavao said he was not confident that his firm would receive any public compensation , which is why it filed the lawsuit against german authorities . cnn 's frederik pleitgen and al goodman contributed to this report .	 new : contaminated sprouts found in west german home .   new : bacteria found in produce for the first time .   four more deaths bring total to 31 .   2988 people are infected , 759 have a severe form of the illness . 	602

4306	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the town of dublin , georgia , is putting saggy , baggy pants in the category of indecent exposure , with violators facing fines of up to $ 200 . dublin mayor phil best said he plans to sign this week an amendment to the municipality 's indecent exposure ordinance . the amendment , which best plans to put into immediate effect at the city council meeting , prohibits the wearing of pants or skirts `` more than three inches below the top of the hips exposing the skin or undergarments . '' `` we 've gotten several complaints from citizens saying the folks with britches down below their buttocks was offensive , and was n't there something we could do about it , '' best said . the mayor said after about a year of fielding complaints , he put the city attorney to work researching how other localities have dealt with the derriere dilemma . the result was that council members decided to put exposure due to baggy clothing in the same category as masturbation , fornication and urination in public places . patrolling for offenders will be left to local police in the town about 140 miles southeast of atlanta . violators could face fines ranging from $ 25 to $ 200 , or court-mandated community service . `` that 's not our intent , we 'd -lrb- rather -rrb- not fine anybody but we are prepared to , '' best said . dublin residents are divided on the issue . lashika haynes supports the push to force folks to pull up , `` it 's just disrespectful by showing your drawers to people , '' she said . but there are those who feel that the ordinance singles out a specific group of citizens . jean wolf , who volunteers with young black men in the community said , `` they 're the ones wearing the saggy , baggy pants . '' wolf said she believes the ordinance will lead to profiling by authorities . mayor best said that accusation is `` ridiculous . '' `` it 's for white , black , man , woman . the ordinance is for everyone , and i 've seen it violated by all races and sexes , '' best said . dublin is not alone in its pull-up-the-pants campaign . riviera beach , florida , and flint , michigan , passed bans against sagging pants in recent years , but the riviera beach legislation later was declared unconstitutional after a court challenge . in the non-judicial realm , a state senator in brooklyn , new york , announced plans earlier this year for a series of billboards featuring young men wearing low-hanging pants and the catchphrase , `` raise your pants , raise your image . '' and up the road from dublin , 62-year-old atlantan `` general '' larry platt made it all the way to `` american idol '' and became an online one-hit wonder with his song `` pants on the ground . '' -lrb- sample lyrics : `` pants on the ground , pants on the ground/looking like a fool with your pants on the ground . '' -rrb- . it is not lost on the mayor and the city council in dublin that this ordinance opens the door to what could be a pretty tricky debate over what is indecent exposure . for instance , how much is too much cleavage , and are certain tattoos indecent ? the mayor seems to welcome the discussion as a natural part of the law-making process . `` i do n't know a law or ordinance that does n't stand scrutiny by the people and the court system . so time will tell . there have been plenty of laws that have gone all the way to supreme court , '' best said . according to the mayor , the local high school already enforces a strict dress code which puts a tight belt around students and their saggy pants , sending violators home for the day . `` it 's time we all have a mutual respect for each other ... what a person does in the privacy of their home is fine , '' best said . `` but if i had an 8-year-old daughter , i do n't think she needs to be subjected to looking at someone 's rear end .

'' mun , who worked with the nsa during his time in the korean military , says that a number of global developments motivated him to act : `` the news about the nsa secretly building the country 's biggest data center ; the house passing the controversial cyber intelligence sharing and protection act -lrb- cispa -rrb- ; the social network media accumulating abundant information on every individual 's life ; google announcing its work-in-progress glass project -- and the list goes on . '' `` sometimes these ideas about privacy can feel large and abstract to the average person . i thought that addressing these issues through the design of a typeface -- a building block of language and communication -- would bring home the conversation to the average person , '' mun says . the four different fonts -- camo , false , noise and xed -- were developed through a rigorous process of drawing and testing , mun says : `` the challenge was to make the ocr legible typeface illegible to computer vision , while keeping it readable to the human eye . '' each font uses a different optical trick to make them difficult to scan : ` camo ' adds camouflage-like patterns over letters , ` noise ' overlays the letters with dots , ` xed ' puts a neat x across each character , and ` false ' uses a small letter beneath a larger ` false ' one . matthew green , research professor of computer science at johns hopkins university , says that of the four different fonts , ` false ' could be most promising , but that in his view camouflaged fonts are not terribly effective at protecting people 's privacy : `` for standard optical character recognition that 's tuned to read traditional typefaces and handwriting , yes , i think -lrb- these fonts -rrb- will be confusing ... but if the nsa really wants to detect this data ? not really . the problem here is that the fonts do n't appear to be randomized , which means every time i type the letter ` a ' i 'll get the same letter . to an ocr program these letters are just shapes . the funny-looking a shape is no more difficult to detect than a real a shape . '' ross anderson , professor in security engineering at the university of cambridge computer laboratory , shares green 's criticisms : `` i do n't think any of this is more than privacy theater . the fonts could probably be broken . '' mun concedes that the fonts ' actual effectiveness may be limited , but that he hopes they will alert people to the issue of digital surveillance : `` zxx is a call to action , both practically and symbolically , to raise questions about privacy . intercepting and storing world citizens ' words and thoughts is simply a vulgar intrusion on our daily lives ... it 's our duty to call out crimes against democracy . '' sang mun 's fonts are available for download here . ross anderson 's font can be found here .	 designer sang mun creates ` unhackable ' fonts .   the four fonts are designed to disrupt optical character recognition software .   experts suggest that to be effective such fonts would need to be used with encryption . 	723

' authorities said mccluskey started sending small amounts of meth to wallin in early 2009 , and the operation grew before it ended in late 2012 , shortly before everyone was arrested . federal officials say mccluskey and laschober sent 1 to 3 pounds a month to wallin over six months . mccluskey also admitted distributing at least 12 pounds of meth to drug sellers in another part of the country . mccluskey once supplied ten pounds of methamphetamine to a priest dealer known as monsignor meth . mccluskey grew up near chicago , graduated from drake university in iowa and held good jobs before his drug addiction did him in , said his lawyer , todd bussert . wallin , 62 , had been the pastor at st. augustine parish in bridgeport for nine years before resigning in 2011 , citing health and personal problems . he previously served as pastor of st. peter 's church in danbury . the diocese of bridgeport indefinitely revoked wallin 's priest powers in 2012 . connecticut police and federal agents said they also discovered during their investigation that wallin had bought an adult video and sex-toy shop in north haven , apparently to launder all the money he was making . wallin 's case drew comparisons to the tv show ` breaking bad , ' about a high school science teacher who became a meth kingpin . mccluskey grew up near chicago , graduated from drake university in iowa and held good jobs before his drug addiction did him in , said his lawyer , todd bussert -lrb- not pictured -rrb- . authorities say the case was unusual because methamphetamine has n't been a big problem in the state as it has in others . in fact , officials said wallin 's case was the first federal prosecution of a meth case in connecticut that they could remember . bussert said mccluskey had a long-standing drug problem . ` this is n't a guy who woke up one day and decided to break bad , ' bussert said .	 chad mccluskey , 44 , supplied nearly 10 pounds of meth to the operation .   monsignor kevin wallin still faces 11 to 14 years in prison for selling massive amounts of the drug .   mccluskey 's attorney called him a good man who lost his way due to addiction . 	630

6279	by . sarah harris . experts warn children are becoming less able to pick up traditional motor skills as they spend so much time using ipads and other modern technology . toddlers these days are barely out of nappies before they are playing with touch-screen toys and fiddling with ipads . and now , it seems , they are paying the price -- because when they arrive at nursery they are apparently struggling to pick up basic fine-motor skills such as holding pencils , pens and crayons . some nurseries have installed interactive ` smartboards ' , digital cameras and touch-screen computers to try to expose children to gadgets at an early age . one of the learning goals in the . revised early years foundation stage -lrb- eyfs -rrb- is that ` children recognise . that a range of technology is used in places such as homes and school ' . under a section on understanding the world , youngsters must also find . out about and ` identify the uses of everyday technology and use . information and communication technology -lrb- ict -rrb- and programmable toys to . support their learning ' . some nurseries have prioritised ict as a result and ploughed resources into improving their facilities . jeff stanford from asquith day nurseries -- which has invested # 4million in digital technology -- defended the move , saying : ` it makes children comfortable and familiar with the technology and that is extremely useful when they start school . ' but literacy expert sue palmer said : ` i think what children really need up to the age of seven is real life in real space and real time , which means three-dimensional experiences . ` we already have problems with children not being able to hold a pen or pencil . ` but we are giving our kids instant gratification all the time with ict and it makes it harder for them to persevere with something that takes a while to learn . ` there is a real fear that too much engagement with this quick-fix technology is making it more difficult for some children to learn how to read and write . ' june o'sullivan , chief executive of the london early years foundation , . said she is not planning to buy ipads for its 24 nurseries . while some schools and nurseries plough millions into having the latest technologies , some experts suggest children could do with less exposure to modern gadgets . she said : ` i know some nurseries are investing in ipads for the children . but we are not doing that here at the leyf . ` ipads are the big thing at . the moment and yet nobody seems to have done much research into them . ` we know art , music and drama works so why bother with something we do n't know enough about yet ? ' and felicity marrian , from iverna gardens montessori in london , said : ` if our children are in fact the most sedentary generation ever , according to the medical authorities , and already spend more time watching television than they do in school , do we really need to add computers and other screen-based devices to the nursery environment ?

' the black hole is now believed to be even more powerful because of the additional mass from the swallowed star . the absorption of large mass such as stars or even other black holes is what gives black holes growth and spawn the existence of super-massive black holes.super-massive black holes could contain up to billions of solar masses . by comparison , the sun is just one solar mass and the earth is 1/332 ,950 th of a solar mass . black holes are probably the strangest cosmic phenomenon that we know about . their gravity is so strong that normal laws of physics just do n't apply , with time actually slowing down at a black hole 's event horizon - the point at which it would be impossible to escape its clutches .	 astronomers watch as nasa telescope captures rare event .   phenomenon only occurs once every 100million years .   radiation from the event travelled for 3.9 billion years before reaching earth . 	631

' mr bishop revealed he managed to secure this incredibly close-up images because the whale had ventured unusually close to the harbour walls . he added : ` at the time i took the pictures i was standing on the port san luis pier along with around to 100 other people . freedom : the pelican finally frees itself from the whale 's mouth in port san luis harbor . big friendly whale : photographer rob bishop said the whale appeared to open its mouth wider to let the bird out before going back under the water . ` the whales had been coming up farther out in the harbour , but suddenly this one came up fairly close to where we were standing . maybe 75 to 100 feet away . ` it is very rare for them to come in this close to where people and boats are . it was amazing because there were so many pelicans flying overhead and diving into the water , a lot of seals also swimming around , and then the whales suddenly coming up so close to us . ` the sounds of all this along with the ooohs and aaahs of the crowd was very surreal . ' the humpback whale - also known as a megaptera novaeangliae - is a species of baleen whale and adults range in length from 12 to 16 metres and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms . humpback whales typically migrate up to 16,000 miles each year and only eat in summer while fasting during the winter .	 unlucky pelican was diving for fish when it collided with the humpback whale .   the bird could easily have been crushed or drowned by the huge mammal .   incredible escape captured by amateur photographer rob bishop at port san luis harbor , avila beach , california .   mr bishop said the whale , which only eats krill and fish , appeared to open its jaws up wider to let the pelican escape . 	697

4581	as far as hurricanes go , sandy is not particularly intense . with peak winds at 90 mph monday at 5 p.m. , it is still classified as a category one , with only a small chance of briefly achieving the low end of category two before making landfall somewhere in new jersey on monday evening . and yet , state and local governments have gone into full alert mode , with schools closed , cities shut down , and evacuations ordered across the eastern seaboard . justifying the alarm are enormous waves arriving onshore , raising the mean water level by a few feet even here in miami , where the winds are blowing directly offshore . sandy could bring ` catastrophe , ' affect 60 million . sandy represents the confluence of a modestly strong hurricane coming up from the caribbean and a fairly strong but not unusual continental weather system -- what meteorologists call a `` trough '' or `` dip '' in the jet stream -- that has been traversing the country over the last few days . in the vast majority of cases , these weather systems weaken hurricanes while at the same time pushing them quickly out to sea . such weather systems also generate their own cyclones , not as intense as hurricanes , but larger and slower moving . opinion : as sandy descends , tips from katrina survivors . when these extra-tropical cyclones form over the ocean and move along the coast , we call them nor'easter s -lrb- for the strong northeasterly winds they generate -rrb- . sometimes , tropical and extra-tropical systems merge , and the hurricane turns into a large ocean cyclone . but again , almost all of these storms move quickly out to sea . there are two elements that make sandy very unusual , possibly even `` super . '' first is its pathway . rather than racing out to sea like most coastal storms , sandy has already turned hard to the left and it will make landfall at nearly a right angle to the u.s. coastline . this extremely unusual track -lrb- from right to left -rrb- means that almost every piece of coastline from new jersey to cape cod will receive onshore winds at some point during the event . second , the core of sandy -- the part that will look and feel like a hurricane -- has remained intact , even as cooler and drier air from the united states wraps around it . thus , sandy has each of the worst features of both kinds of storm : a small core of hurricane-force winds around its center , and a broad expanse of gale-force winds extending hundreds of miles outward that will batter the shorelines for several days . why did this happen ? it was simply a matter of positioning . sandy arrived east of florida at exactly the right time and place to get the maximum benefits from its interaction with the dip in the jet stream . as a result , sandy became large enough to influence that system as well , and the two will wrap around each other into a single , deep cyclone , 800 miles across , extending from the ground to 40,000 feet in the sky . this will add to the duration of the event as the circulation takes several days to wind down over pennsylvania and new york . opinion : climate change raises stakes for coast . as for whether sandy is a `` superstorm , '' perhaps we should refrain from such a designation until after the event . there was already a `` superstorm '' in march 1993 -- a nor'easter that dumped snow from new orleans to canada . there was the halloween storm of 1991 -- later known as the perfect storm -- which , like sandy , also grew from the confluence of a large extra-tropical cyclone and a hurricane -lrb- which , unlike sandy , was destroyed in the process -rrb- . and there was the blizzard of ' 78 , the eastcoaster of 1996 , and others . sandy will take its place in history , but we will not know what that place is until many days have passed .	 david nolan : as far as hurricanes go , the storm we call `` sandy '' is not very intense .   nolan : there are two elements that make sandy unusual , possibly even `` super ''   he says sandy 's right-to-left pathway is atypical , as is its intact hurricane core .   nolan : sandy will take its place in history , but we 'll have to wait until it 's over to know where . 	720

1982	few predictions are certain when it comes to the future of air travel ... except this one . it looks like being a lot more comfortable . a british company has come up with adjustable plane seats you can book to suit your shape and size . it means larger passengers need not worry about squeezing into uncomfortable , tight spaces , moving to business class or paying double -- they just book an expanded seat to fit them . and families can enjoy more comfortable flights without taking up more overall space -- mothers and fathers can add a few notches to their seats while smaller children can have theirs scaled down . the morph , as the seat has been called , also allows for the possibility of slimmer travellers paying less for occupying smaller spaces . the design by london firm seymourpowell has already attracted attention from plane manufacturers such as boeing and airbus . details of passengers ' sizes and needs will be fed into a computer and airline staff then adjust the varied seating arrangements at a touch of a button before take-off . morph works by replacing the traditional foam pads used in airline seats with a fabric that is stretched across the width of three seats , around a frame and over formers , a little like a hi-tech hammock . it promises comfort without reducing leg room . unlike traditional seats , which are created individually using foam padding , the new design is based around a single piece of fabric stretched across the back of a frame for three seats . another piece of fabric is placed along the bottom , creating a hammock-style chair . the frame includes ` formers ' which move up or down underneath the fabric , allowing the passenger to alter the recline , as well as the height and depth of the seat pan , according to their size and comfort . crucially , the formers , which act as arm rests and dividers between the three seats , can also be moved left or right to alter their width , making the seats bigger or smaller . economy class airline seats are , on average , around 18in wide . squeezing into a small airline seat could become a thing of the past , but larger people might have to pay more for their airline seat if the new morph concept becomes a reality . but the morph seats would allow , for example , a couple travelling with a young child to book two larger 22in seats to improve their comfort , while the child would occupy a smaller and cheaper 10in seat . jeremy white , of seymourpowell , admitted that some airlines were resistant to charging people according to their size , but claimed passengers would welcome improved choice . larger travellers could see it as a better option than being charged twice over . ` one airline told us that if they have an oversized passenger , they make them buy two seats , ' he said . ` i ca n't think of anything more degrading or humiliating than forcing someone to buy two seats because they are a bit wide . ' the seats can be reclined and adjusted to suit an individual 's preferred seated position by moving the seat ` formers ' , which in turn morphs the fabric to provide a ` tailored fit and greater comfort , ' according to the firm . mr white said the seats can also be adjusted to suit other needs such as privacy for lone travellers , mothers with children , people working or less abled passengers . the seats are unlikely to be fitted into existing aircraft , so it could be more than a decade before the morph design is introduced . however , some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans . air new zealand 's dreamliners feature ` skycouches ' , a row of three economy seats that can be turned into a sofa . and earlier this year airbus announced it would be offering an additional two inches on some aisle seats on its new a320 jets to keep up with ` demographic trends ' . analysts have suggested imposing a ` fat tax ' on passengers above a certain weight to cope with demands from larger passengers . in april , samoa air became the first airline to operate a ` pay-by-weight ' system .	 british design firm seymourpowell has designed morph to offer passengers choice over the amount of space they pay for .   the width of the seat can be adjusted , .   while an individual can also control the seat pan height and depth , to .   make sure they are comfortable .   morph uses a fabric that is stretched across .   the width of three seats , around a frame and over formers , a little like .   a hi-tech hammock . 	753

2831	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- on tuesday , january 12 2010 , the world watched in horror as haiti was struck by a catastrophic earthquake . at least 100,000 people lost their lives in the devastation . in the aftermath , many people around the world sent financial aid to help support survivors . but one young entrepreneur was so affected by the tragedy that he sat down at his desk to try to lend his professional skills to future relief efforts . having watched the disaster unfold on tv , francisco aguilar , a graduate from mit sloan and the harvard kennedy school , began working on a tool that could be used to help in emergency response situations around the world . `` if you remember the 2010 earthquake in haiti , you saw hundreds of thousands of people buried under the rubble . after an earthquake most people die in the first 48 hours . people who are trapped tend to die in the first 48 hours . and the international rescue teams came with their very sophisticated equipment , and did a fantastic job when they got there , -lrb- but -rrb- they did n't get there for 48 hours . and their tools , their fiber optic scopes , and all the kinds of equipment that they have , cost $ 50,000 , and are very hard to use . so , despite their very valiant efforts , they pulled out a few hundred people , but most of the damage was already done , '' aguilar says . the device aguilar invented is called the bounce imaging explorer -- a small black probe about the size of a baseball , fixed with an array of sensors and cameras that can be thrown or dropped into dangerous environments . `` the initial thought was , how could we create something that was easy to use , that could allow a first responder , or even a volunteer , to easily look inside a space to determine whether it was safe to enter it , to see if there was a victim inside , '' aguilar says . `` and that moved from search and rescue , to police who often face hostage situations : aggressive shooters , or terrorism . to fire fighting applications , where people often want to search different rooms in a complex , before having to enter or decide whether there is a fire or not . so there 's a common problem across first responders of having to decide whether to enter a house or a space . and we are trying to make it cheap and easy to get images while they are out of there . '' to develop the product aguilar partnered with david young , an entrepreneur who spent four and a half years as a us army infantry officer . the bounce imaging explorer 's cameras and sensors can quickly take panoramic images after being thrown into an inaccessible space . the impact resistant shell can also house heat sensors , geiger counters , vibration antennae or smoke detectors to provide different information in different kinds of emergencies , such as natural distasters or swat team hostage rescues . the ball then broadcasts its findings back to a mobile device to give users information on whether there are hazards -lrb- or indeed survivors -rrb- around a corner , or buried beneath fallen debris . the company , bounce imaging , won a gold award of $ 50,000 at masschallenge , and was named one of time magazine 's best inventions of the year . gianfranco zaccai , ceo of design consultancy continuum , said : `` i think that the concept is really great in its simplicity ... there 's a lot of potential there , and there 's a lot of potential for doing good with it , because if you think about , the dangerous world that we live in , we need simple , robust , usable ideas that are embedded in great products . '' aguilar hopes to begin producing the bounce imaging explorer next year , and says he aims to keep the cost between $ 500 and $ 1000 .	 u.s. graduate francisco aguilar invents throwable camera called the bounce imaging explorer .   the shock absorbent baseball-sized tool can be thrown into hostile situations to assess risk .   it is a low-cost piece of equipment that could help first responders in developing countries . 	710
3397	plans have been drawn up for an advertising campaign denouncing britain as cold and wet to deter romanians and bulgarians from coming to the uk . ministers are working on ideas to prevent an influx of immigrants from eastern europe when restrictions are lifted on citizens from the two countries moving to the eu next new year 's day . a public information campaign would warn those considering a move that they wo n't be able to cash in on state largesse -- and that the weather is bad . with a lifting of regulations on romanians and bulgarians in the uk the government is considering a number of options to avoid the country 's border being clogged with new migrants . under proposals being examined in downing street , the home office and the department for work and pensions , the new migrants -- who are expected to number at least 70,000 over the next five years -- would face tough restrictions on the benefits they could claim . one option would see new arrivals deported after three months if they do n't have a job . another plan would require those arriving from romania and bulgaria to show they have the means to support themselves for six months . the ` nuclear option ' would be to declare an ` economic emergency ' to defer arrivals -- though government lawyers are nervous about the legality of such a move . once the plans to limit the amount of money new arrivals can claim are in place they are likely to form the heart of an advertising campaign later this year . a senior government source told the mail : ` by the time people are able to come here we would want to have something in place and we would want people considering coming here to know what they could expect .

2857	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in the last few weeks , the media has been ablaze with news of the government shutdown , the debt limit and health care reform . missing from most public debate , however , is the cut to the supplemental nutrition assistance program , or snap , benefits that will take place on november 1 and will affect every one of the more than 47 million americans who depend on the program to help meet their basic nutritional needs . when the changes are implemented , everyone enrolled in the snap program will see their benefits cut . for example , a family of four that qualifies for the maximum monthly benefit will lose $ 36 a month -- that 's a 5 % reduction . while this may not seem like a lot , i speak from experience when i say $ 36 provides much more than you might think . this past september , i participated in the snap challenge . for a week , i stuck to a budget of about $ 1.50 per meal , the average snap benefit for one person . it was a tough week . i found myself drained and constantly thinking of food . when the snap cuts take effect next week , benefits will average about $ 1.40 per meal . i ca n't imagine the strain this will place on struggling families who are counting every penny and trying to stretch their benefits . eatocracy : the food stamp challenge . most families do not have enough to make it through the month already -- 90 % of snap benefits are redeemed by the third week of the month and 58 % of food bank clients currently receiving snap turn to food banks for help at least six months out of the year . the upcoming cuts will result in an increased need for food assistance at food pantries and soup kitchens across the nation when many are already stretched meeting sustained high need in the wake of the recession . at feeding america , we 're doing everything we can to prepare our network of food banks for the increased demand , but charity alone can not make up for the impending $ 5 billion loss in snap funding . the reduced funding will result in the loss of nearly 1.9 billion meals in the next year . that 's more than half of feeding america 's total projected output for 2014 . the cuts this week are significant and will put a strain on millions of families struggling with food insecurity , hitting them right before the holiday season . adding to this is the fact that congress is considering much deeper cuts to snap benefits and eligibility restrictions that will affect millions of low-income people as part of the farm bill . in september , the house passed legislation cutting $ 40 billion in snap over the next 10 years , according to a feeding america analysis . together with this week 's cuts , the pending legislation will result in a loss of nearly 3.4 billion meals for low-income americans in 2014 alone , according to a feeding america analysis . these are meals our most vulnerable citizens can not afford to lose , and food banks and other charities simply can not fill that gap . while we can not stop this week 's snap cuts , we can prevent further cuts from taking place . call your member of congress and tell them not to cut snap . helping our neighbors in need is a fundamental american value , and fighting hunger is a public-private partnership . we need a strong charitable system and a strong federal anti-hunger safety net . working together , individuals , charities , business and government can solve hunger . do your part to make sure no one in america goes hungry . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of bob aiken .	 food stamp benefits will be cut about 5 % starting nov. 1 .   bob aiken says this will hurt america 's struggling families , and more cuts could come .   aiken says food banks wo n't be able to fully take up the slack .   he says americans already often use up food stamps and need help from food banks . 	672

' prevention : frequent hand washing is the best way to stop contracting norovirus . he said there is no treatment for norovirus other than to let the illness take its course with symptoms normally lasting about two days . norovirus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through contact with an infected person or contaminated surfaces and objects . it is known to spread rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals , schools and nursing homes . last month hospitals said they have been so overwhelmed by people suffering fromsickness bugs that paramedics were forced to care for 999 patients . ambulances were left queuing outside several hospitals in greater manchester - including wythenhsawe hospital , pennine acute trust ` snorth manchester general , royal oldham , rochdale infirmary and fairfield hospital in bury . symptoms include sudden vomiting , diarrhoea , or both , a temperature , headache and stomach cramps . the bug usually goes away within a few days . although people can suffer from norovirus at any time of the year , activity increases in the winter months , with most cases seen between january and march . in the united states , the centers for disease control and prevention say norovirus causes 21 million illnesses a year , with 70,000 cases requiring hospitalisation and around 800 ending in death . ian goodfellow , a scientist who has studied norovirus for 10 years , describes it as `` the ferrari of the virus world '' and `` one of the most infectious viruses of man '' .	 most people taken ill with norovirus caught the strain sydney 2012 .   the variant was first identified in the uk in october but is already dominant .   number of cases of the winter vomiting bug rose as much as 63 per cent compared to last year . 	662

4933	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- serbia is `` ready to talk '' with kosovo and `` we will do so in good faith , '' serbia 's president told the u.n. general assembly on saturday . `` soon the two parties will be talking to each other for the first time in many years , '' said president boris tadic . `` we must be patient and seek out those issues which allow confidence to be built on each side , '' he added . `` there will be many issues to discuss and some of them will be complicated . you all can contribute to an atmosphere that creates trust . '' kosovo had long been a restive province of serbia with a majority ethnic albanian population until it declared independence in feburary 2008 . this followed a civil war that raged in the 1990s between kosovo albanian insurgents and serb security forces and belgrade-backed kosovo serb paramilitaries . after that , the region operated under a u.n. mission and a nato-led peacekeeping force . serbia and many ethnic serbs staunchly opposed the kosovo independence move regard kosovo as serbian territory and refuse to recognize its sovereignty . tadic said `` serbia 's position remains unchanged '' and that the `` unilaterally declared independence of kosovo '' wo n't be recognized . kosovo is recognized by dozens of countries , including the united states . but russia backs serbia in rejecting its independence . russia , a traditional serb ally , also opposed nato intervention in kosovo in 1999 . the u.n. general assembly recently adopted a landmark resolution calling for talks between serbia and kosovo , and the international court of justice recently ruled that kosovo 's declaration of independence `` did not violate general international law . '' serbia , which says `` statehood has never been attained without the consent of the parent state , '' says there is not yet a `` clear settlement '' of the serbian-kosovo matter . he said it is critically important that the u.n. member states that have not recognized kosovo 's independence `` to stay on the course of non-recognition '' during talks . `` this will be a significant contribution to ensuring that unilateral attempts to impose outcomes to ethnic and territorial disputes are not legitimized , '' he said .	 boris tadic delivers address to u.n.   he reiterates serb stance on kosovo .   u.s. and dozens of other nations recognize kosovo 's indepence . 	392
4944	deposed egyptian president mohamed morsy on sunday taunted court officials who placed him in a soundproof glass box during his trial on conspiracy charges , a proceeding cut short by his lawyers ' objections . `` if this farce continues , leave the trial , '' morsy told his lawyers through a microphone . `` those who are afraid of my appearance before the people have no public support , '' he added . morsy , egypt 's first democratically elected president , was toppled in a military coup in july and faces trial on a variety of charges -- the most recent being allegations that he spied for an unnamed foreign power . sunday 's session marked the second time he was placed in a glass enclosure . when he was hauled into court along with nearly three dozen co-defendants , his lawyers complained the soundproof enclosure hindered their ability to communicate with their client . `` the glass dock is to humiliate the defendants , '' said mohamed selim el-awa , his lead attorney . `` this is unprecedented in the world . '' el-awa told cnn that the defendants ca n't hear inside the glass-enclosed dock and that presiding judge shaaban el-shamy is n't the only one controlling the sound . the judge refused requests to discuss this issue in private , making it impossible for the lawyers to do their job , he said . and ahmed morsy , the ex-leader 's son , said , `` this is what the coup authorities want . '' with defense lawyers refusing to participate , proceedings were adjourned until february 23 . the judge threatened to appoint new lawyers , and the defense attorneys appeared divided over whether they should return . el-awa said the withdrawal would remain in effect until the glass barrier is removed . `` what is important is that i have n't gone against my conscience , '' el-awa said . but defense spokesman mohamed el damaty said that given the court 's threat to appoint new attorneys , morsy 's lawyers may have to submit to the `` bitter reality '' and continue their defense in later sessions . the trial is one of several that morsy is facing amid egypt 's seesaw power struggles . the latest charges against him include spying for foreign organizations outside egypt , committing terrorist acts inside the country , disclosing classified defense information to a foreign country and funding terrorism . he already has been charged with inciting the killings of political opponents and organizing a 2011 jailbreak by members of his then-banned muslim brotherhood . morsy , the former head of the brotherhood 's political arm , won office in 2012 . shortly after he was elected , he resigned from the muslim brotherhood and its freedom and justice party in an effort to show he would represent all egyptians . but he was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule , with opponents accusing him of pursuing an islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government . morsy and other brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts , including organizing attacks on egyptian troops in the sinai peninsula and fueling `` sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in egypt . '' the brotherhood had long been suppressed during the 29-year rule of former strongman hosni mubarak . but it became the most powerful political force in egypt after the popular revolt that toppled mubarak in 2011 . supporters say the military-backed government that replaced morsy has returned to the authoritarian practices of mubarak .	 those who fear his appearance `` have no public support , '' morsy declares .   defense lawyers object to the placement of soundproof glass where defendants stand .   morsy became president in 2012 , but was deposed in a military coup one year later .   his supporters say the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of hosni mubarak . 	619

1887	earth is 365 million miles -lrb- 588 million km -rrb- away from jupiter and 830 million miles -lrb- 1.3 billion km -rrb- from saturn . but these heavyweights of our solar system have a huge influence on what goes on in our planet , and could be to thank for humanity 's existence . the orbits of these planets are keeping our world moving in a circular path at just the right distance from the sun for life to flourish . moving saturn 's orbit just 10 per cent closer to the sun creates a tug that would stretch out earth 's orbit by tens of millions of miles . this view is looking towards the sunlit side of saturn 's rings from about 25 degrees above the ringplane . moving saturn 's orbit just 10 per cent closer to the sun creates a tug that would stretch out earth 's orbit by tens of millions of miles . this is according to elke pilat-lohinger of the university of vienna , austria , who has developed computer models to understand how jupiter and saturn affected the shape of other planets ' orbits . using a simple model that did not include other inner planets , professor pilat-lohinger found that the greater the tilt , the more the elongation in earth 's orbit , according to a report by jeff hecht in the new scientist . jupiter 's gravity , which is 2.5 times stronger than that of earth 's , is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own . when mars and venus were added to the model , the orbits of all three planets stabilised slightly , but saturn 's tilt still had a major influence on earth . when mars and venus were added to the model , the orbits of all three planets stabilised slightly , but saturn 's tilt still had a major influence on earth . it is known as the ` death star ' due to a crater making it look like the star wars weapon . however , astronomers say they are a step closer to solving a mystery that has baffled them for decades about saturn 's moon mimas . the moon has an odd wobble - and scientists say its core is is either wonky or awash with water . it has a tell-tale wobble that is twice as big as expected for a moon with a regular , solid structure . mimas is mostly made of ice and has a diameter of 246 miles -lrb- 396km -rrb- . the researchers offer two explanations for the wobble : either it has a vast ocean beneath its surface , or a rocky core with a weird shape resembling a rugby ball . apart from these gentle ` librations ' , mimas otherwise presents the same face to saturn throughout its orbit . the model found that 20-degree tilt of saturn would bring the earth 's orbit closer to the sun than venus . it would also cause mars to leave the solar system entirely . in a similar study earlier this year , the university of new south wales and royal holloway university of london , ran various computer models of our solar system . with each iteration , the planets in the solar system remained in their place while jupiter moved around in different obits , ranging from circular to elliptical . the scientists also moved the entire orbit of jupiter inwards and outwards to test what would have happened if the planet had formed closer to the sun , or further away . each simulation was taken through a million year time frame , recording where earth would have been every 100 years as a result of jupiter 's position . ` the default assumption is this is something that is important , ' said jonti horner , an astronomer and astrobiologist at the university of southern queensland . ` there 's a lot of flexibility where jupiter will be , and you would assume that you 'd have a very smooth , very gentle variation in how the earth 's orbit behaves over time . ' while jupiter 's locations resulted in little change in earth 's orbit and tilt , the effect on earth 's climate remained unclear . jupiter 's gravity , which is 2.5 times stronger than that of earth 's , is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own .	 bringing saturn 's orbit 10 per cent closer to sun creates a tug on earth .   tug is strong enough to stretch earth 's orbit by tens of millions of miles .   this is according to computer models created by university of vienna .   jupiter has a far more gentle variation in how the earth 's orbit behaves . 	759

' the coffee industry currently uses guidelines on the ideal water for coffee extraction from the speciality coffee association of europe , which puts emphasis on measuring ionic conductivity to quantify the total dissolved solids . however , the research found it was in fact the proportions of these ions that affected the extraction , and therefore the taste , of the coffee . ` hard water is generally considered to be bad for coffee , but we found it was the type of hardness that mattered - while high bicarbonate levels are bad , high magnesium ion levels increase the extraction of coffee into water and improve the taste , ' mr hendon said .	 water composition makes a ` dramatic difference ' to coffee from same bean .   softened water does not a good cup of coffee make .   java tastes analysed by scientists at university of bath . 	396

' the big issue is likely to be over cost , especially for premiership rugby , as the hawkeye system would be more expensive that the current tmo system which just uses the existing tv feeds . the league is also adamant that the decisions made via the tmo at the final on saturday were proved to be correct . wait for it : the referee consults tmo during the heineken cup semi-final between saracens and clermont . ` aviva premiership rugby became the first league in the world - at considerable cost - to introduce the television match official into every match , not just those that are televised live , ' said a premiership rugby spokesman . ` we are therefore committed to doing everything in our power - with other stakeholders , including the irb and rfu -lrb- rugby football union -rrb- - to make sure we help the match officials get every decision right . ` we are constantly looking at ways to improve the tmo process to help our match officials and although we have spoken to hawkeye we have no plans to use it at the moment .	 hawkeye are in talks with the international rugby board about replacing the controversial television match official system .   tmo was criticised for taking four minutes to decide the aviva premiership final between northampton and saracens .   hawkeye has been used for football goalline technology , tennis and cricket . 	604

1146	they say power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . but now it seems there could be a scientific reason why the trappings of success and elevated position can make people more likely to be dishonest , according to a new study . researchers found that expansive physical settings , such as having a big desk to stretch out while doing work , or a large driver 's seat in a car , can cause people to feel more powerful . this may , in turn , elicit more dishonest behaviour - such as stealing and cheating , or even traffic offences , they claim . researchers found that expansive physical settings , such as having a big desk to stretch out while doing work , can cause people to feel more powerful . the new research , published in the journal psychological science , discovered that the physical environment may affect the likelihood of dishonesty . study leader doctor andy yap , who spearheaded the research while at columbia business school in the united states . he said : ` in everyday working and living environments , our body postures are incidentally expanded and contracted by our surroundings - by the seats in our cars , the furniture in and around workspaces , even the hallways in our offices - and these environments directly influence the propensity of dishonest behaviour in our everyday lives . ' trappings of success , such as having a big car , may , in turn , elicit more dishonest behaviour - such as stealing and cheating , or even traffic offences , researchers claim . building on previous research . demonstrating that expansive postures can lead to a state of power , and . that power can lead to dishonest behaviour , the new study suggests that . expanded , non-verbal postures forced on people by their environments . could influence decisions and behaviours in ways that render people less . honest . people who are considered unattractive are more likely to be belittled and bullied in the workplace , according to new research . the study by michigan state university found that unattractive workers were treated more harshly than their attractive colleagues when it came to promotions and which tasks they were given to do . and that being ` ugly ' played more of a role in how someone is treated than their age , gender or how long they had worked there . previous research has found that attractive students tend to be more popular in school . however , this study , led by associate professor of management at the university brent scott , is the first to find a direct correlation between attractiveness and bullying in the workplace . the research included findings from four studies conducted in the field and the laboratory . in one study , the researchers manipulated the expansiveness of workspaces in the lab and tested whether ` incidentally ' expanded bodies - shaped organically by one 's environment - led to more dishonesty on a test . another experiment examined whether participants in a more expansive driver 's seat would be more likely to ` hit and run ' when incentivised to go fast in a video game driving simulation . to extend results to a real-world context , a field study tested the ecological validity of the effect by examining whether car drivers ' seat size predicted the violation of parking laws in new york city . the field study revealed that cars with more expansive driver 's seats were more likely to be illegally parked on new york city streets . dr yap , who is now a visiting professor at mit sloan school of management in the us , said the research indicates that while people may pay very little attention to ordinary and seemingly innocuous shifts in bodily posture , these subtle postural shifts can have tremendous impact on our thoughts , feelings and behaviour .	 study says it elicits dishonest behaviour , such as stealing and cheating .   claims physical environment may affect the likelihood of dishonesty .   american study published in journal psychological science . 	668

2470	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- kids having sex on prime time broadcast tv ? must be sweeps month . it 's so predictable , it 's almost laughable . almost . that is , it would be if it were n't for the fact that there are real-world consequences for these brazen , ratings-boosting publicity ploys . fox 's soapy , teen-targeted `` glee '' tried to boost sagging ratings this week by showing not one , but two teen couples having sex for the first time -- one gay , the other straight . show co-creator ryan murphy and the folks over at `` glee '' are spinning this as a `` teachable moment '' for teens and their parents , an opportunity for dialogue about safe sex and responsible choices . the problem is ryan murphy wants to have his cake and eat it , too . hollywood loves to defend teen sex story lines by insisting , `` kids are having sex ! we 're reflecting the real world ! '' but the truth is much more sobering and complicated . yes , there are and always have been sexually active teens , but never before have depictions of premarital teen sex been so widespread in the media . today , you are more likely to see sexualized teens than adults in sexual situations . by presenting teen sex as common , the media marginalizes teens who choose to remain abstinent while increasing the pressure teens are already feeling to become sexually active . television is a `` sexual super peer , '' according to jane brown , a professor of journalism and mass communication at the university of north carolina . the phrase `` peer pressure '' is used to describe the influence a peer group can exert on a teen 's decisions . television amplifies that peer pressure by making the entire realm of television , and all the characters in it , part of the teen 's peer group . when television portrays attractive , popular teenage characters as sexually active , it sends a powerful message to young viewers that there is an expectation that they , too , should be sexually active and , in fact , there might be something wrong with them , if they are n't . teens are also aware that television influences their behavior . according to one survey , a third of youths age 12 and older say the media encourages them to have sex by making it seem like `` everybody does it . '' and why should n't they get that impression ? beyond making teen sex the norm , researchers have found heavy television viewing to be predictive of positive attitudes toward `` recreational '' or casual sex and negative attitudes toward remaining a virgin . studies have also found the more a teenager identifies with the characters they see on prime time tv shows , the more likely they are to be sexually experienced and to expect higher levels of sexual activity among their peers . at least half a dozen studies in the past few years have documented a strong correlation between exposure to adult media content as children and the early onset of sexual activity among teens . one study even found that viewing of sexual media content was predictive of teen pregnancy . if that is n't enough , why exactly do parents and teens need to sit down and watch a tv show that glamorizes teen sex in order to have a conversation about it ? let 's hope most parents pass on hollywood 's attempt to help them out with the visuals and simply have an honest conversation with their teenagers . if history is a predictor of future behavior , we can expect this trend to continue . a season or two into murphy 's show `` nip/tuck '' on the fx network , he was interviewed for a bravo network documentary about breaking sexual taboos on television . murphy stated , `` it 's tough to get that sexual point of view across on television . hopefully i have made it possible for somebody on broadcast television to do a rear-entry scene in three years . maybe that will be my legacy . '' this , ladies and gentlemen , is the self-styled sex-ed teacher to america 's teens . the worst thing parents can do is step aside and let hollywood do the teaching . the opinions in this commentary are solely those of melissa henson .	 this week 's `` glee '' showed two teen couples -- one straight , one gay -- having sex for first time .   melissa henson says young viewers could feel that they , too , should be sexually active .   henson : never before have depictions of premarital teen sex been so common in the media .   worst thing parents can do is step aside and let hollywood do the teaching , henson says . 	762

' end scene : state police troopers said surveillance footage shows that mr myatt ignored a warning horn and looked to be purposefully waiting until the exact time that the train was approaching to get on the tracks . the couple met when they were 17 years old and had been married for 42 years at the time of their death . he rearranged his work schedule at the mohawk valley community college bookstore so that he started at 3.30 am and was able to finish earlier in the afternoon in order to spend more time with his ailing wife . ` we were spoiled in receiving two fantastic parents , ' brad told syracuse.com . ` she was his world .

2792	aachen , germany -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- three men have been sent to prison for the acid attack that nearly blinded sergei filin . but the artistic director of the bolshoi ballet says that nothing can give him back what he has lost . in an exclusive interview with cnn in aachen , germany , on the day his attackers were sentenced in a moscow court , filin said the attack had dented his spirit as well as leaving him in agony and partially disfigured . `` it 's not just a problem with my eyes , it 's a problem with my heart , '' he said . filin now wears dark glasses much of the time and has undergone numerous surgeries in germany since the attack in a moscow street last january . and he bears the pain of knowing that it was one of the dancers in his own world-renowned company who masterminded the attack , star soloist pavel dmitrichenko . dmitrichenko was sent to prison for six years tuesday , while accomplice yuri zarutsky was sentenced to 10 years and driver andrei lipatov got four years . filin said he accepts the court 's verdict and sentencing -- but he is not prepared to forgive and forget . `` of course not , i can not forgive them because there is no sentence nor punishment today that would enable me to recover my eyesight , the eyesight that i once had , '' he said . `` what will happen in the course of my future treatment , nobody knows . whatever is ahead , it will be a struggle .

'' he was eventually helped by passersby . but the damage was already done -- and the next time he was seen in public , it was with his head swathed in bandages and third-degree burns to his face and eyes . when it emerged that dmitrichenko was behind the attack , the dark rivalries and score-settling at the heart of the bolshoi were laid bare , amid allegations of affairs , corruption and jealousy . filin does not believe that different actions on his part might have resulted in a different outcome . `` those accusations that we have heard have not been underpinned by any evidence , '' he said . `` they are all lies aimed at lessening the degree of guilt or punishment for this crime . '' cnn 's matthew chance reported from aachen and laura smith-spark wrote in london .	 `` it 's not just a problem with my eyes , it 's a problem with my heart , '' says sergei filin .   filin says he accepts court 's verdict for his attackers but can not forgive them .   `` it hurt all over my skin and i immediately felt an atrocious pain in my eyes , '' he says of attack . 	622

4428	-lrb- cnn -rrb- former international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said his trial , which wrapped up friday , was the first time his side of the aggravated pimping case against him has been fully heard . he 'll learn june 12 whether investigative magistrates accepted his version . a verdict by the lille court will be read on that date . the onetime contender for the french presidency has denied investigators ' accusations that he organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes . `` for the first time , throughout these last hearings , i felt i could explain myself and i have the feeling i have been listened to , '' strauss-kahn said . strauss-kahn appeared to get a boost earlier this week when the lille prosecutor told the court that the defendant should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence . lille prosecutor frederic fevre 's statement conformed with what his office said more than a year ago : that the evidence did n't support the charges . but investigative magistrates nevertheless pursued the case to trial , which began two weeks ago . investigators alleged that the sex parties , in locations such as belgium , new york and washington , stemmed from a prostitution ring , organized from the hotel carlton in lille . strauss-kahn , who was married to french tv journalist anne sinclair until their divorce in 2013 , has never denied that he took part in the parties . but the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved . in testimony last week , he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda , but he denied organizing them or asking anyone else to do so for him . `` i do n't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever , '' he said last week . in france , prostitution is legal , but pimping is not . prosecutors allege that two other defendants , businessman david roquet and fabrice paszkowski , a businessman friend of the former imf director , picked up the bills for the sex parties . strauss-kahn saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in new york in 2011 . he was later cleared of the new york allegations . before that scandal erupted , he had been on track to run for the french presidency -- an election that his socialist party later won with francois hollande as its candidate . the lille prosecutor 's office in late 2013 asked for strauss-kahn 's case to be dismissed , citing a lack of evidence . however , the investigating magistrates did not follow its recommendations . a judgment in the case could come `` within months , '' fevre 's spokeswoman , maud perraudeau , said tuesday . cnn 's laura smith-spark contributed to this report .	 strauss-kahn : `` i have the feeling i have been listened to ''   prosecutor 's office has long said there was n't enough evidence to pursue the case .   but investigative magistrates pursed case against him and others . 	497

4771	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- nato 's leader confidently proclaimed on sunday that libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's days are numbered , but he could n't foresee how long the alliance 's grinding mission to protect besieged civilians will last . `` the game is over for gadhafi , '' nato 's secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told cnn 's `` state of the union . '' `` he should realize sooner rather than later that there 's no future for him or his regime . '' nato 's anders fogh rasmussen on the endgame in libya . rasmussen , a former danish prime minister , believes gadhafi will be ushered out of power amid the `` wind of change '' sweeping across north africa and the middle east , and the dramatic military strides in afghanistan and pakistan . `` this week we have seen a major blow to al qaeda and osama bin laden 's evil vision of conflict as a means to create conflict between the muslim world and the rest of the world . and in afghanistan , the taliban is under pressure everywhere , so basically i am very optimistic , '' he said , making reference to the killing of bin laden by u.s. navy seals on monday in pakistan . the alliance has been carrying out a u.n. security council resolution calling for the protection of civilians from the gadhafi regime by any means necessary , and since march 31 , its planes have been pounding targets across the country . according to nato 's latest daily operational update , nato planes struck several targets on sunday , including an ammunition storage site in the zintan region , tanks in misrata and ajdabiya , military vehicles in al-brega , and headquarters compound buildings and ammunition and vehicle storage facilities in hun , south of sirte . there have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time . rasmussen was asked when the nato operation would be completed but all he could say was `` it needs an end of the mission . '' `` we have defined three very clear military objectives , '' he said . `` firstly , a complete end to all attacks against civilians . secondly , a free and unhindered and immediate access for humanitarian assistance . and thirdly , a withdrawal of gadhafi military forces and paramilitary forces to their bases and barracks . when these objectives are fulfilled , our mission is accomplished . '' he said `` it 's hard to imagine '' that the `` outrageous and systematic attacks '' by pro-gadhafi forces against libyans will halt as along as gadhafi stays in power . he said there needs to be a political and not a military solution with a `` peaceful transition to democracy '' as gadhafi leaves power . but the conflict rages on . the tunisian state news-agency reported on sunday that 50 people were injured when government forces and rebels clashed near the tunisian-libyan border on saturday . gadhafi 's forces on saturday bombed key fuel depots in the besieged city of misrata , destroying six containers and causing a massive fire , a rebel spokesman said . meanwhile , in the de facto rebel capital , benghazi , the libyan opposition said saturday that italy has agreed to arm the rebels . abdul hafiz ghoga , deputy chairman of the national transitional council , said opposition representatives have flown to italy to finish the deal . the italian foreign ministry categorically denied it will send weapons to libya . a press office spokesman said italy will only go as far as sending non-lethal weapons such as satellite and radar systems to aid the rebels . the rebels , intent on winning on the ground without foreign troops , have been asking for arms supplies as the war rages in cities like misrata .	 rasmussen cites the ` wind of change ' in the arab world .   there 's no way to gauge the end of the mission , rasmussen says .   nato planes strike more targets in libya . 	666

6117	a new batch of australian anti-drinking videos encouraging young people to hold back on the booze is actually doing more harm than good , experts warn . the drinkwise videos form part of a new anti-booze campaign designed to detract young people from hitting the bottle . the online ads , posted to youtube , feature a man in a suit promoting drinking as a classy social activity only to be enjoyed in moderation . drunks are portrayed as ` dickheads ' and the message that drinking ruins reputations , is an unattractive social norm and inhibits men 's appeal to the opposite sex is a recurring theme throughout . scroll down for video . encouraging : health experts believe the anti-drinking campaign could have a positive affect on alcohol sales , doing more harm than good . appealing to young adults : one advertisement encourages university students to make a judgement call to determine whether taking out a loan is worth the the high price of alcohol . it is implied that sober men are more appealing to mothers , and this is a reason why men should n't get drunk . the mostly minute-long ` classy as f *** ' videos attempt to offer tips on how to be an ` experienced ' drinker rather than an ` amateur .

' one of the study 's authors , dr charles nelson , a developmental neuroscientist in boston , said the findings suggested that there was a sensitive period in the first two years of a child 's life , when foster care has the greatest impact on their progress . ` the younger a child is when placed in foster care , the better , ' he added .	 children in care have less grey and white matter than those brought up in a typical home environment .   research could explain why children in care are more likely to develop mental health problems .   study led by researchers from harvard university and boston children 's hospital . 	486

' he added : ` britain is not going to turn its back on the energy sources of the future . so we 've set out a generous new tax regime for shale gas and removed the bureaucratic obstacles to its use onshore and offshore . ' a friends of the earth spokesman said : ` it 's astonishing that ministers want to end people 's right to be notified about plans to drill for gas and oil under their homes . ` it 's little wonder communities do n't trust the government over fracking when their rights are so clearly being bulldozed aside to smooth the path for the big fracking firms . ' chancellor george osborne stepped up the fracking campaign and said britain will not ` turn its back on the energy source of the future ' the dclg is inviting responses to its proposals until october 14 , but has no fixed timetable for implementing the changes . plans to revise the oil and gas planning regime came as cuadrilla withdrew its own planning application , admitting it had not consulted people living above areas where it wants to drill . a company spokesman said it was ` coincidence ' that cuadrilla withdrew its planning application 24 hours after it emerged that the government might change the rules . it is expected to resubmit its application , potentially delaying operations in balcombe .	 plans would make it easier for companies to drill miles underground .   residents of sussex village of balcombe say fracking made their life a misery .   chancellor george osborne stepped up support for fracking .   he said : ` britain will not turn its back on the energy of the future ' 	702

' criticism : tory mp peter bone says the government 's decision undermines the status of marriage . documents issued by the department for . culture , media and sport yesterday suggested that couples in civil . partnerships will have a choice about whether or not to hold a separate . ceremony to mark the conversion of their relationship to marriage . ` we will enable couples to have a ceremony upon conversion should they wish to do so . ` the ceremony would have no legal effect and would be similar to existing ceremonies allowing couples to renew their vows -lrb- and would therefore incur a separate cost -rrb- . accordingly a couple would be able to have such a ceremony on religious premises , if agreed with the religious organisation and any representatives of that organisation who would be involved in the ceremony . ' despite the change , married couples will not be able to convert their relationships into civil partnerships . officials said there was ` no justification or requirement for introducing such a process ' . and , to the dismay of some campaigners , ministers refused to extend civil partnerships legislation to cover heterosexual relationships . gay rights campaigner peter tatchell . condemned the decision , saying : ` retaining the ban on opposite-sex civil . partnerships is a huge failing . it deprives heterosexual couples of . legal equality . i strongly support the right of straight people to equal . treatment . ' wedding bells : if civil partners so wish they can have a ceremony to mark their conversion which would function as a renewing of their vows and not have any legal effect . he added : ` under the government 's plans , gay couples will soon have legal privileges over heterosexual couples . ` there will be two forms of official state recognition for lesbian and gay couples : the present system of civil partnerships plus marriage . heterosexual couples will have only one option - marriage . ' in a further change , heterosexual couples will no longer have to divorce if one partner has a sex change . if both partners agree they will be able to retain their married status . the government announced today that it will introduce a bill next year legalizing gay marriage - but banning the church of england from conducting same-sex ceremonies .	 conversion would see same-sex couple able to change the legal status of their civil partnership .   equality campaigners condemn decision not to allow straight marriages to convert into civil partnerships .   tory mp peter bone say it undermines marriage . 	650
