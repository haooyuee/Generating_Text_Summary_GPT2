"-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- gone are the days of the grainy camera phone images with the resolution of a poor imitation monet . today 's smartphone cameras are so advanced that mobile photography is becoming an art form in its own right , turning photo-sharing apps like instagram into portable galleries for amateur photographers , and professionals like street style photographer tommy ton and chief official white house photographer pete souza . `` you have the dark room in your pocket , '' says pierre le govic , the paris-based founder of out of the phone , the world 's first publishing house dedicated to mobile photography . this month , out of the phone follows its debut publication , last year 's book of mobile photos from two-time pulitzer prize-nominated photographer richard koci hernandez , with out of the phone : the mobile photo book 2014 , a diverse selection of 100 instagram images taken by users from 25 countries . democratizing photography . before founding out of the phone in 2013 , le govic ran a fine art photography printing company that counted daido moriyama and william eggleston as clients . he first started following mobile photography on instagram in 2011 , and was surprised and impressed by the quality of work that hobbyists were creating . `` now there are many well known photographers who use the platform , but at the very beginning , there were many people who did n't know so much about photography , and these were the kind of people that i wanted to showcase , '' he says . `` but on the other hand , it was also something confusing because there are too many images . '' the desire to curate what he was seeing , coupled with a longtime ambition to create books , led him to give publishing a try . while le govic had preselected a number of established photographers to feature in this year 's inaugural anthology -lrb- he 's hoping it will become an annual publication -rrb- , he also gave instagram users the chance to put themselves up for consideration , using the hashtag #outofthephone to nominate their best works . he was astounded to receive over 20,000 submissions . what was he looking for in a successful entry ? technical skill was understandably important , but le govic says he also sought something less tangible . `` at the end , what is important is the story and the sensibility of the photographer ... it 's a mix between a good story , a good composition , '' he says . `` photography , for me , is a sort of fresh air , a way to look at things differently . so i 'm looking for that sort of feeling when i look at pictures . '' preserving `` moments of grace '' now that the mobile photo book has been published , le govic is looking forward to promoting his concept and expanding . he 's looking to start hiring in the new year -lrb- so far , it 's been a one-man operation -rrb- , and solicit investors and partners . several projects are set for release next year , including books from award-winning documentary photographer benjamin lowy , and other photographers he believes are using the medium to its fullest . `` some images deserve to get to paper because it 's a kind of memory , '' he says . `` if i can help to keep memory of interesting moments , some moments of grace perhaps ... i think it 's interesting to fix them on paper and to alert to people not to forget them .

' australian researchers had previously . discovered that these fossils contained soft tissue . now with the . help of ahlberg 's team and the esrf synchrotron in grenoble , france , they have managed to resconstruct the . musulcature of the fish . an artist 's impression of what the placoderm fish that the australian fossils came from would have looked like . placoderms were among the first jawed fish and their jaws are thought to have evolved from their gill arches . their name comes from the greek for ` plate-skinned ' "	rare soft tissue taken from fish fossils found in north west australia show that the fish had powerful abdominal muscles . swedish scientists claim that these are not unlike those muscles found in human six packs . living fish have simple body musculature meaning scientists can use this discovery to track how abs changed and evolved . 	"The 380-million-year-old fossils of placoderm fish from northwestern Australia provide a rare glimpse into the evolution of abdominal muscles, similar to the human six-pack. The fossils, found in the Gogo Formation, reveal well-developed neck and abdominal muscles in these extinct fish, challenging previous assumptions about the sophistication of vertebrate musculature at that time."
